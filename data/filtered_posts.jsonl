{"post_id":"1k6csnh","subreddit":"WGU","title":"MSSWE, DevOps Engineering - D777 Real Life Applications of Data Structures - Task 1","selftext":"* Degree: Master of Science in Software Engineering, DevOps Engineering (MSSWE)\n* Class: D777 Real Life Applications of Data Structures\n* Class Type: Performance Assessment (PA)\n   * *Note: PA has 2 parts*\n* Passed Task 1 on 1st submission\n\n**Overview**\n\nThis class covers using data structures for building software, but more so using existing libraries for the data structures instead of coding them yourself. The class only has a PA and the PA has two tasks. This post covers Task 1 for the PA.\n\nTask 1 is writing a paper discussing which data structures and Python libraries to use for a Warehouse logistics company to create inventory and order management software for them.\n\n*Important to note: Task 1s description provides a set of business requirements that you must keep in mind while writing the paper for each section of the rubric*\n\n**Estimated Time**\n\n* I completed writing the PA in 1 day, although I did spend a few days going through the course material\n\n**Task 1 Requirements**\n\n1. **Section A:**\u00a0You're selecting x number of data structures that could be used for this inventory and order warehouse management application that can meet the business requirements\n   1. Advice: Refer to the course material because it covers the different data structures and algorithms in depth\n   2. Tip: Refer to the table of the different data structures in\u00a0*\"Chapter 13 - Data Structures Libraries, Section 13.2 Data Structures Comparisons\"*\n2. **Section B:**\u00a0You're comparing (i.e. space\/time complexities, trade offs, how they meet the business requirements, etc...) the data structures that you selected in Section A; and you recommend the best data structures to use out of the ones you identified in Section A, which you justify using empirical data and theoretical analysis\n   1. Tip: Refer to the table of the different data structures in\u00a0*\"Chapter 13 - Data Structures Libraries, Section 13.2 Data Structures Comparisons\"*. This table goes over the different time\/space complexities for the data structures\n   2. For the empirical data to justify my data structure recommendation I searched for articles of companies using the data structure in their software\n   3. *Note: You can also refer to each Chapter for the data structures, specifically the time and space complexity part*\n3. **Section C:**\u00a0You're selecting from a list of Python libraries WGU provides to use to implement the data structures you selected in Section B\n   1. Idk if in this section we were supposed to only select libraries for the recommended data structures in Section B, or all of the data structures you proposed in Section A. I ended up selecting Python libraries for all of the data structures I called out in Section A\n   2. *Note: The course material covers some of the libraries*\n\n**Notes**\n\n1. Constantly keep referring to the business requirements in the \"Scenario\" section while you're answering each section of the rubric\n2. I'd recommend referring to\u00a0*\"Chapter 14 - Combining Data Structures in Problem Solving\"*\u00a0if you wanted an idea of how to approach Task 1\n3. Don\u2019t overthink things too much. I was overthinking Task 1 at first, then decided to keep it simple and see if my PA passes\n\n**Side Notes**\n\n* Just like for the bachelors I did at WGU, I copy\/pasted each section from the rubric into my paper and just answered the questions for each section\n* My paper only has 1 paragraph lol. All of the rest is tables or bullet points touching on each section of the rubric requirements","permalink":"\/r\/WGU\/comments\/1k6csnh\/msswe_devops_engineering_d777_real_life\/","created_utc":1745448494,"score":1,"text_length":3552,"vader_compound":0.9769,"course_code":"D777"}

Usually video courses work great for me, but this time it just wasn't sticking. Here's what I believe would be most efficient for me if I had to do it all again (and possibly for you too doing it now!):\n\nI'd start by reading the syllabus and answering all of the questions using the information from the Axelos book and relating things to\u00a0*something*\u00a0I'm familiar with (like work or school or a store I love shopping at). The syllabus outlines the exact definitions and topics you need to know, and where in the Axelos book to find them. Then I'd read Claire Agutter's Essentials book end to end, supplementing my existing syllabus answers with the extra information that seems useful. Next, I'd make flashcards to memorize definitions, main concepts, and some of the extra fluff that I might encounter on the test. Finally, any topic I find myself struggling with I would break down into simpler terms. I'd take some practice exams (highly recommend Dion though you should know his exams aren't perfect) to confirm I'm good to go by regularly scoring 80%+. Right before the exam, I'd read Dion's cram card to just get a final reminder of all the terms. I wouldn't actually bother with any of the video material personally, but there's a lot of videos out there that helped others so I wouldn't be afraid to try them either if this didn't seem like it would work. All of these materials are accessible for free through various WGU resources (the Axelos book is in the course material, the cram card was in a welcome email, and Claire's book was linked in my Voucher Approval email).\n\nAlso, my mentor told me I'd have to pass a pre-assessment exam before getting the voucher - she was wrong and that was not required.

{"post_id":"1iu3wwc","subreddit":"WGUIT","title":"ITIL D336 Passed","selftext":"As title says, passed the ITIL Foundations exam. This exam was passed overnight and I felt it was pretty easy. The hardest part of this is the lack of transparency on where to learn the material. Of course you have your typical go-to's like Jason Dion, but I actually found his ITIL course NOT helpful. The exam is built on key definitions and ITIL is ambiguous as it is applied in different structures and models dependent on the organization using ITIL. For me it seemed Jason Dion's videos were more set in stone on what ITIL looks like as a bigger picture rather than broken down to each component of ITIL for you to understand. I stopped watching the videos about 40 minutes in.\n\nSurprisingly, Youtube saved the day. After about 5 hours of studying using the free playlist by value insights (https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=HloUhMK4E6I&list=PLVzkjYR3xN1V9nlcECuygEZVlS4rj5qaf) and 2 mock exams by Jason Dion, I took the test right after with PeopleCert and passed with an 88% (35 out of 40 questions).\n\nI would not stress the analogies given to each concept such as user and customer and service provider so much. Or the diagrams showing SVS & SVC. That only complicated things for me midway through the videos.\n\nOverall I would say this is definitely an easy course but the more you stress it, the more you're going to struggle.

{"post_id":"znidq0","subreddit":"WGU_CSA","title":"D303 - Azure Fundamentals","selftext":"Hey all\n\nLast night I took and passed the Azure fundamentals exam, AZ-900. \n\nHere are a few thoughts on it for those looking to take it soon. \n\nFirstly, I didn't study much for this exam, I have my Cloud+, and my AWSCP certifications from previous WGU classes. Those gave me a solid grounding in Cloud concepts before taking this. I decided that I would go through the Udemy course for the exam by Scott Duffy. Genuinely though, I ran through about 1\/2 of it. Then my job became very busy and I didn't have much time to study before my exam date. Instead of rescheduling, I decided to go for it. \n\nExam Tips: The minimum passing score is 700, and the stated number of questions is 36. However, that number is highly misleading. More than 3\/4th of the questions were actually not just one question but a set of several Yes\/no questions that you had to reason through. Most of them were sets of 3, meaning that although it says you have 36 questions, it's more like 70-80 questions. You also get some drag-and-drop correct answer type questions and even a couple of ones where they show you a picture of Azure's portal and you have to select the right button for something. \n\nLastly you still only get 45 minutes for the actual exam so time management is important. \n\nHere's some advice for you if you are about to take it. Go through the Udemy course for this material. They just changed the exam on Oct 28th, 2022 so be sure that the course you are taking is updated with those changes. Also, if you have the cloud+ certification, you have the cloud concepts down, but Azure-specific info, especially about the Azure Active directory, availability zones, region pairs, etc. You should study those to give yourself the best chance to do well in them. \n\nI hope this helps, as always, if you've recently taken this exam, please comment and give tips for others taking this path. Good luck everyone!","permalink":"\/r\/WGU_CSA\/comments\/znidq0\/d303_azure_fundamentals\/","created_utc":1671207304,"score":13,"text_length":1925,"vader_compound":0.9919,"course_code":"D303"}
{"post_id":"zk3gb7","subreddit":"WGU_CSA","title":"D336 Tips","selftext":"Hey guys, I just passed D336 business of it - applications ITIL 4 exam through people cert. \n\nThe exam format was reminiscent of CompTIA exams, all multiple choice. Though it had a lot more of the \"what is the best\/closest to X thing\" type of questions than most exams I've taken. It felt very much like they wanted to know if you understood the concepts more than specific knowledge. A few of the questions were straight definitions of words from the glossary. Most however required you to think of the processes and parse out the answer. \n\nHow I prepared: I prepared for about a week before taking the exam. My term started Dec 1st, I took the exam on Dec 8th. As soon as I hit start on the course, I requested exam approval from the teacher in order to motivate myself to hit it hard and pass it. \n\nI spent about 1-2 hours daily prepping for it. I went through the insight value playlist on YouTube: \n https:\/\/youtube.com\/playlist?list=PLVzkjYR3xN1V9nlcECuygEZVlS4rj5qaf\n\nSuper quick, but very helpful. Also the same guy did a follow-up which went though about 50 practice questions that was very good.  I watched\/listened to it all at about 1.25-1.5 speed. \n\nThe Jason Dion practice exams on udemy we're great for a the last day or two prior, I did those, using the course book as a reference for any ones I didn't understand or got wrong. \n\nFinally, I skimmed the course workbook. Especially things like the service value chain\/activities. Running through those and some of the larger chapters was amazingly useful. \n\nI hope this helps someone. If you've recently done this course please add any other tips below for those who are struggling with it. From what I've seen, it's a black and white type of experience. Either it's really easy and quick or people struggle for weeks with it. \n\nGood luck everyone!","permalink":"\/r\/WGU_CSA\/comments\/zk3gb7\/d336_tips\/","created_utc":1670861857,"score":6,"text_length":1753,"vader_compound":0.9939,"course_code":"D336"}

This gave me general idea where i needed to deep dive.\n\n5- download the pre assessment as a pdf, make sure all questions and answers are shown.\n\n6- this is the most important one, used google Gemini to help me review the questions from the pre assessment one by one and will do the following with each question:\nA- ask him to pull the question without any analysis.\nB- tell him what i think the question is asking and how i would approach the solution and ask him to confirm, however if i felt that i REALLY do not have an idea how to approach the question i will ask him to breakdown what is the question is asking and how i can approach it.\nC-once it confirmes that my understanding of the question and my approach i will attempt to solve the question, however if it says that my approach is incorrect i would ask him to break it down.\nD- Ask him to provide me with an question similar to one reviewed and attempted to solve it\n(BTW when i solve the question i tell him what i did step by step to make sure my answer was not by luck and I'm using the right formulas and steps) \nF- when i feel that there was bunch of questions i struggled with i would ask him for a quick recap for what was explained on those specific questions by topic and approch. And\/or ask how would i speed up the process using the process of elimination or bruce fort the answer from the choices and how would my calculator would help me to get this answer to be able to save time in the exam.\n\n7-took the OA, had to guess and the last 15 questions as i was running out of time but as you can see that was not much of a factor as Modeling Computation scores low and most of those questions were Probabilities and Modeling Computation.\n\nnPr, nCr and remainder() aka mod() functions where such an assist to speed through. Also when asked to solve RSA encryption use (e*d) mod (p-1 * q-1) == 1 plug answers from the choices to d and check which answer gives you 1 that's the answer. Understanding the big-o and how to analyze pasedo code was really helpful (i will attach my notes to the 1st comment that Gemini helped me with to summarize big o and identify it quickly) \n\nI understand some of you would say this is a core class and understanding it deeply is important and this method might not achieve that. however i believe i learned a lot and have deep understanding for most of the material before starting the course. I was in a time crunch, working full time and taking care of family and personal life had its events. You always can go back and build more on a concept.\n\nIs is the best way? No as you see i was so close to fail however it can diffantly be a booster if you want to combine it with other techniques. Or maybe my luck charmrd.\n\nBest of luck for all of you.","permalink":"\/r\/WGU_CompSci\/comments\/1jz2gue\/discrete_mathematics_ii_passed_the_1st_time_my\/","created_utc":1744646446,"score":52,"text_length":3446,"vader_compound":0.9966,"course_code":"C960"}

The main textbook was the core material, and it was hard to read \u2014 super dry and difficult to comprehend.

And finally, I\u00a0**handwrote notes from those notes**\u00a0\u2014 yes, I made **a lot** of notes. :) But it helped the material stick. With how abstract the course was, I needed that repetition.\n\nFor the\u00a0**Ethics Principles**, I asked AI to\u00a0write me a novel \u2014 with characters, plot, and drama (lol) \u2014 that covered every single principle\u00a0and highlighted how each organization differed in practice. It made it\u00a0*way*\u00a0easier to remember who does what and why.\n\nFor the\u00a0**Operating Systems**\u00a0portion, I didn\u2019t find the [famous YT playlist](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/playlist?list=PL8dPuuaLjXtNlUrzyH5r6jN9ulIgZBpdo) helpful personally.

I\u2019d rate this course as a\u00a0**3\/5 difficulty**. It\u2019s not impossible, but it\u2019s not light reading either.

The project has to be run in JDK17 because of a Lombok compatibility issue.  My course instructor insisted there was something I could change to fix it, but couldn\u2019t tell me what that was.  From everything I could find, JDK versions are user-level preferences and not something I could set in the project outside of the POM file notation that came with the project.  In the end, I resubmitted as-is with a note to the evaluator to please make sure they used JDK17 to avoid a compile error.  It passed on the second attempt.","permalink":"\/r\/WGU_CompSci\/comments\/1jj3unz\/d387_advanced_java_pa_returned_for_compiling\/","created_utc":1742855057,"score":1,"text_length":1447,"vader_compound":-0.6674,"course_code":"D387"}

{"post_id":"1jfx8wa","subreddit":"WGU_CompSci","title":"D-686: OPerating Systems for Computer Scientists GUIDE","selftext":"Hello everyone, I just passed this class today, and I know there isnt much info on here about this course, so I figured I'd spread my strategy\/thoughts.\n\nFirst of all, I really appreciated how this zyBook was laid out. It was nice that there was alot of instructor love in it. Throughout the book there is clear instructor direction of what to skip, and what to read. You could avoid all of the information that is not important for this class, saving a presumed incredibly larger amount of time. Of the book, you only roughly do half of it. I really hope they do this with Comp Arch soon! I did skip the last few chapters on security, as from previous courses I carry an understanding of those. I scored perfect on the test in those sections. This class was really handholdy in the best ways.\n\nAfter the zyBook, I watched all of the cohorts and videos of things I didnt fully understand (all in the supplemental resources). These were made for C130 (131?) but they translated well. These are well done, and very informational. I did look at the udemy course, but did not engage in any of those materials.\n\nLastly, I requested the 2nd attempt information from my CI (I would highly recommend doing that before taking your first OA attempt in any class you take). He sent me a study guide designed for D686 that I could not find anywhere else. I completed that mostly in its entirety, skipping the stuff I knew or understood well. The content of this study guide really aligned with the OA well. \n\nNow the test. The PA I felt was a really good tool to define where I stood in this class. There were quite a few similar questions on my OA. I took it a total of 3 times, passing the last time. After this I reviewed a bit more, and took the OA. The OA was quite similar to the PA. It did have a few curveballs, but nothing too crazy. I passed the OA on the first attempt. I think the zyBook is enough to pass this class, and it was relatively straightforward.\n\nImportant topics for the test are:\n\n* Know STREAMS\n* Know synchronization, and process managment\n* Know I\/O operations, controllers and driver operations\n* Know Security\n* Know Linux commands (basic)\n* Know Windows, MAC, and Linux\n* Know mounting, and the steps in order.\n\nThats all I can think of. I hope this helps everyone.","permalink":"\/r\/WGU_CompSci\/comments\/1jfx8wa\/d686_operating_systems_for_computer_scientists\/","created_utc":1742498821,"score":24,"text_length":2348,"vader_compound":0.9916,"course_code":"D686"}
{"post_id":"1jfvmzu","subreddit":"WGU_CompSci","title":"Introduction to Computer Science - D684 | study materials\/questions","selftext":"# OPERATING SYSTEMS (Q1\u2013Q30)\n\n# Q1: What is an operating system (OS), and what are three major responsibilities it fulfills?\n\n**A1**:\n\n* An **OS** is the main software layer that manages computer hardware and provides services for applications.\n* It **allocates resources** (CPU, memory, I\/O), **manages processes** (scheduling, execution), and **provides user interfaces** (command line, GUIs).\n\n# Q2: How does an OS manage CPU, memory, and secondary storage resources?\n\n**A2**:\n\n* **CPU Management**: Schedules processes or threads (time-sharing, prioritizing).\n* **Memory Management**: Allocates\/reclaims RAM, handles virtual memory.\n* **Secondary Storage**: Manages file systems, organizes data on disks.\n\n# Q3: What is the difference between a process and a program?\n\n**A3**:\n\n* A **program** is a **passive** collection of code\/instructions on disk.\n* A **process** is an **active** instance of that program in execution, with its own resources (memory, PCB).\n\n# Q4: List the common process states and describe how a process transitions among them.\n\n**A4**:\n\n* **States**: New \u2192 Ready \u2192 Running \u2192 Waiting \u2192 Terminated.\n* **Transitions**:\n   * **Ready \u2192 Running** when scheduled.\n   * **Running \u2192 Waiting** if it needs I\/O.\n   * **Running \u2192 Ready** if preempted.\n   * **Waiting \u2192 Ready** when I\/O completes.\n\n# Q5: What is a Process Control Block (PCB), and what information does it contain?\n\n**A5**:\n\n* **PCB** is a data structure holding all info about a process: process ID, state, program counter, CPU registers, scheduling info, memory limits, open files, etc.\n\n# Q6: Compare preemptive vs. non-preemptive scheduling. Why might an OS prefer preemptive scheduling?\n\n**A6**:\n\n* **Preemptive**: The OS can interrupt a running process to run another.\n* **Non-preemptive**: Once a process starts, it runs until completion or blocks.\n* **Preference**: Preemptive scheduling improves responsiveness and fairness in multitasking.\n\n# Q7: Briefly describe Round-Robin scheduling vs. Shortest Job Next (SJN).\n\n**A7**:\n\n* **Round-Robin**: Each process gets a fixed time slice in a cyclic queue. Fair but can have high context switching.\n* **SJN (Shortest Job Next)**: Chooses process with the shortest expected execution time; optimizes turnaround time but needs accurate job length estimates.\n\n# Q8: What is context switching, and why does it cause overhead?\n\n**A8**:\n\n* **Context switching** is saving a running process\u2019s state and loading another\u2019s.\n* Causes overhead because the CPU does extra work saving\/restoring registers, memory maps, etc., rather than executing user processes.\n\n# Q9: What are threads, and how do user-level threads differ from kernel-level threads?\n\n**A9**:\n\n* **Threads** are lightweight units of execution within a process.\n* **User-level**: Managed in user space; fast context switches, but OS sees only one thread.\n* **Kernel-level**: Managed by OS; more overhead but true parallelism on multicore CPUs.\n\n# Q10: Define multiprogramming and timesharing. How do they improve resource use?\n\n**A10**:\n\n* **Multiprogramming**: Multiple processes loaded in memory, CPU switches among them to maximize utilization.\n* **Timesharing**: Rapid switching giving multiple users the illusion of dedicated CPU. Improves user experience via quick interactivity.\n\n# Q11: What tasks does a memory manager handle, and why is memory protection crucial?\n\n**A11**:\n\n* **Tasks**: Allocation\/deallocation of memory spaces, tracking usage, swapping\/paging.\n* **Protection**: Prevents one process from overwriting memory of another, ensuring system stability\/security.\n\n# Q12: How does paging work, and what is a page fault?\n\n**A12**:\n\n* **Paging**: Divides memory into fixed-size pages\/frames. Process pages load into any free frame.\n* **Page fault**: Occurs when a process tries to access a page not currently in RAM, prompting the OS to load it from disk.\n\n# Q13: Compare segmentation to paging in memory management.\n\n**A13**:\n\n* **Segmentation**: Memory is divided into variable-sized segments (code, data, stack).\n* **Paging**: Uniform fixed-size blocks.\n* Segmentation aligns with program structure; paging simplifies allocation but can lead to fragmentation.\n\n# Q14: Define virtual memory. What advantage does it offer?\n\n**A14**:\n\n* **Virtual memory**: Extends RAM with disk space, giving processes the illusion of large contiguous memory.\n* **Advantage**: Allows more\/larger programs to run simultaneously by swapping pages as needed.\n\n# Q15: What is thrashing, and how can an OS mitigate it?\n\n**A15**:\n\n* **Thrashing**: A state where the system spends excessive time swapping pages in and out of memory instead of executing.\n* **Mitigation**: Reducing multiprogramming load (fewer processes), better page replacement algorithms, sufficient RAM.\n\n# Q16: What is the difference between demand paging and prepaging?\n\n**A16**:\n\n* **Demand Paging**: Loads a page only when needed.\n* **Prepaging**: Loads some pages proactively, anticipating future requests. Reduces initial page faults but may waste memory if unneeded.\n\n# Q17: Why might an OS keep file system management separate from process management?\n\n**A17**:\n\n* **Modular design**: Each component (filesystem vs. process manager) can be developed, maintained, and debugged independently. Enhances reliability and maintainability.\n\n# Q18: How does an OS enforce file permissions?\n\n**A18**:\n\n* Via **permission bits or ACLs** (Access Control Lists) that store read\/write\/execute rights.\n* Important for restricting unauthorized access and ensuring data security.\n\n# Q19: Summarize the OS role in managing I\/O devices.\n\n**A19**:\n\n* The OS uses **device drivers** for hardware specifics, handles **interrupts** for asynchronous events, and offers a **standard interface** (APIs) for processes to perform I\/O.\n\n# Q20: Define deadlock. Name the four conditions that must occur for a deadlock to happen.\n\n**A20**:\n\n* **Deadlock**: Processes can\u2019t proceed because each is waiting for a resource held by another.\n* Conditions: **Mutual exclusion, hold and wait, no preemption, circular wait**.\n\n# Q21: What is the critical-section problem? Give a scenario requiring synchronization.\n\n**A21**:\n\n* **Critical section**: A piece of code accessing shared resources.\n* **Scenario**: Two threads updating a shared bank account balance. Synchronization prevents inconsistent states.\n\n# Q22: What is a semaphore, and how does it help prevent race conditions?\n\n**A22**:\n\n* A **semaphore** is a special integer variable used for signaling.\n* Threads must acquire\/release it, ensuring one thread modifies a shared resource at a time.\n\n# Q23: Name two inter-process communication (IPC) mechanisms and a use case for each.\n\n**A23**:\n\n* **Pipes**: Parent-child process data transfer.\n* **Message queues**: Multiple processes exchanging structured messages (server logs, sensor data).\n\n# Q24: How does a real-time OS differ from a general-purpose OS?\n\n**A24**:\n\n* **Real-time**: Guarantees response within strict time constraints (e.g., embedded medical systems).\n* General-purpose OS aims for overall throughput but not guaranteed time bounds.\n\n# Q25: Why are embedded OSs typically smaller and more specialized? Provide an example.\n\n**A25**:\n\n* They run on limited hardware (small memory\/CPU) and handle specific tasks.\n* Example: OS in a smart thermostat or car\u2019s engine control system.\n\n# Q26: Compare microkernel vs. monolithic kernel architectures.\n\n**A26**:\n\n* **Microkernel**: Minimal kernel (IPC, scheduling) with OS services in user space. Smaller, more secure, but potential overhead.\n* **Monolithic**: All core services in one big kernel. Fast, but less modular.\n\n# Q27: Name three common threats an OS must defend against, and how it addresses each.\n\n**A27**:\n\n* **Malware**: Via antivirus, sandboxing.\n* **Unauthorized access**: User authentication, file permissions.\n* **Exploits (buffer overflow)**: Security patches, memory protection, address randomization.\n\n# Q28: What is a virtual machine? Differentiate type-1 vs. type-2 hypervisors.\n\n**A28**:\n\n* **VM**: A software emulation of a physical computer.\n* **Type-1**: Runs on bare metal hardware (ESXi).\n* **Type-2**: Runs atop a host OS (VirtualBox, VMware Workstation).\n\n# Q29: Briefly describe the boot process from power on to a running OS.\n\n**A29**:\n\n* **Power On \u2192 BIOS\/UEFI** loads bootloader \u2192 bootloader loads OS kernel \u2192 kernel initializes devices\/processes \u2192 OS starts user environment.\n\n# Q30: How have operating systems evolved from batch systems to modern multiuser systems?\n\n**A30**:\n\n* **Then**: Early computers ran one job at a time (batch).\n* **Now**: Time-sharing, networking, GUI, multiuser capabilities.\n* Driven by user demands for interactivity, resource sharing, and complex multitasking.\n\n# FILE SYSTEMS (Q31\u2013Q45)\n\n# Q31: How do file systems organize and manage data on storage devices?\n\n**A31**:\n\n* They define how **files\/directories** are structured, track locations on disk, manage free space, handle metadata, and enforce access control.\n\n# Q32: What attributes might a file system store for each file?\n\n**A32**:\n\n* **Filename, size, creation date\/time, modification date\/time, owner, permissions, file type.**\n* Helps identify, secure, and manage files.\n\n# Q33: What is the role of directories, and how do single-level vs. hierarchical structures differ?\n\n**A33**:\n\n* **Directories** group files for organization.\n* **Single-level**: All files in one shared space.\n* **Hierarchical**: Nested folders, more flexible, a tree-like structure.\n\n# Q34: Distinguish absolute vs. relative path references with an example.\n\n**A34**:\n\n* **Absolute**: Full path from root (e.g., `C:\\Users\\Mubarak\\Report.docx`).\n* **Relative**: Path from current directory (e.g., `..\\Images\\photo.jpg`).\n\n# Q35: How do disk scheduling algorithms (e.g., FCFS, SSTF, SCAN) optimize read\/write operations?\n\n**A35**:\n\n* They reorder requests to minimize **head movement**.\n* **SCAN** sweeps across the disk in an elevator-like pattern; more efficient than random FCFS.\n\n# Q36: Compare contiguous, linked-list, and indexed file allocation.\n\n**A36**:\n\n* **Contiguous**: All data in consecutive blocks (fast access but fragmentation).\n* **Linked-list**: Each block points to next (fragmentation can slow random access).\n* **Indexed**: Uses an index block containing pointers to data blocks (flexible direct access).\n\n# Q37: Why are file extensions used, and how do OSs decide how to open a file?\n\n**A37**:\n\n* File extensions (e.g., `.docx`, `.png`) hint the file type.\n* OS looks up a **file association** (registry or config) to launch the appropriate program.\n\n# Q38: Explain how ownership and group permissions refine access control.\n\n**A38**:\n\n* Each file\/directory has an **owner** (sets default permissions).\n* Groups allow multiple users to share the same permission set, enhancing collaboration.\n\n# Q39: What is disk formatting, and why use partitions?\n\n**A39**:\n\n* **Formatting**: Prepares a storage device with a file system structure.\n* **Partitions**: Divide one physical disk into segments, letting each act as a separate logical volume for organization or multi-OS setups.\n\n# Q40: In Unix-like systems, what does mounting a file system mean?\n\n**A40**:\n\n* **Mounting**: Linking a storage device (or partition) into the existing directory tree at a mount point. Makes that file system accessible to the OS.\n\n# Q41: What is an inode, and what key metadata does it store?\n\n**A41**:\n\n* **Inode**: Data structure that stores file metadata (permissions, owner, size, timestamps, disk block pointers), but not the filename itself.\n\n# Q42: How does a journaling file system (e.g., NTFS, ext4) improve reliability?\n\n**A42**:\n\n* It keeps a **journal** (log) of changes. In a crash, the system replays or rolls back incomplete transactions, reducing corruption.\n\n# Q43: How does file locking prevent conflicts with multiple processes?\n\n**A43**:\n\n* Locking ensures **exclusive** or **shared** access. Prevents overwriting or inconsistent reads\/writes. E.g., editing a shared doc on a network drive.\n\n# Q44: What is a network file system (like NFS), and how is it different from a local file system?\n\n**A44**:\n\n* **NFS**: Allows remote file access over a network as though local.\n* Unlike local file systems, data is sent over the network, not stored on the local disk.\n\n# Q45: Name two potential security vulnerabilities in file systems and how they\u2019re mitigated.\n\n**A45**:\n\n* **Unauthorized file access**: Mitigated with strict permissions, ACLs.\n* **Data tampering**: Use checksums, journaling, or encryption to detect\/correct corruption.\n\n# COMPUTER ARCHITECTURE & COMPONENTS (Q46\u2013Q70)\n\n# Q46: Summarize the Von Neumann Architecture.

What is CI\/CD?\n\n**A85**:\n\n* DevOps merges development + operations for continuous delivery and faster iteration.\n* **CI\/CD**: Automated builds, tests, deployments, ensuring rapid and reliable software updates.\n\n# ALGORITHMS & PSEUDOCODE (Q86\u2013Q100)\n\n# Q86: What is an algorithm, and how do we measure complexity?\n\n**A86**:\n\n* **Algorithm**: A sequence of steps to solve a problem.\n* **Complexity** measured via **Big O**, e.g., O(n), O(log n). Reflects performance scaling.\n\n# Q87: Show a short example of sequence, selection, and repetition in pseudocode.\n\n**A87**:\n\n* **Sequence**: `x = 5; y = x * 2; print(y)`\n* **Selection (IF)**: `if score > 60 then print(\"Pass\") else print(\"Fail\")`\n* **Repetition (While)**: `while count < 5 do count = count + 1`\n\n# Q88: Compare linear vs. binary search in approach and time complexity. When is binary search inappropriate?\n\n**A88**:\n\n* **Linear**: Check elements in order (O(n)).\n* **Binary**: Repeatedly half the search space (O(log n)) in a **sorted** array.\n* **Inappropriate** if data is **unsorted** or very small.\n\n# Q89: Summarize Insertion Sort vs. Merge Sort. Which scenario might favor each?\n\n**A89**:\n\n* **Insertion Sort**: Build sorted sublist by inserting one item at a time (good for small or nearly sorted data).\n* **Merge Sort**: Divide & conquer, recursively split and merge sorted halves (stable, O(n log n), good for large sets).\n\n# Q90: Describe divide and conquer with a real-life analogy and a programming scenario.\n\n**A90**:\n\n* **Analogy**: Splitting a big puzzle into smaller sections.\n* **Programming**: Merge Sort or Quick Sort repeatedly subdivide data, then combine results.\n\n# Q91: Show pseudocode for a WHILE loop until a user inputs \u201cquit.\u201d Why is pseudocode language-agnostic?\n\n**A91**:\n\n    plaintextCopyEditinput = \"\"\n    while input != \"quit\"\n        input = get_user_input()\n        \/\/ process input\n    endwhile\n    \n\n* **Language-agnostic** because it focuses on **logic**, not syntax specifics.\n\n# Q92: How do you define a subprogram (function) with parameters in pseudocode? Provide an example.\n\n**A92**:\n\n    plaintextCopyEditfunction calculateArea(length, width)\n        return length * width\n    endfunction\n    \n\n* Demonstrates parameters `(length, width)` and returns a result.\n\n# Q93: Why might a developer choose a flowchart over pseudocode, and one limitation of flowcharts?\n\n**A93**:\n\n* **Flowchart**: Visual, easy to grasp for non-developers or for high-level process mapping.\n* **Limitation**: Can become unwieldy\/complex for large algorithms.\n\n# Q94: Give an example where recursion simplifies code, and a scenario where iteration might be more efficient.\n\n**A94**:\n\n* **Recursion**: Navigating a tree or fractal pattern. Conceptually simple.\n* **Iteration**: Large loops without the overhead of recursive calls (e.g., summing a million elements).\n\n# Q95: Write pseudocode for a for-loop printing numbers 1 to 10, and name the loop control variable.\n\n**A95**:\n\n    plaintextCopyEditfor i = 1 to 10\n        print(i)\n    endfor\n    \n\n* The loop control variable is `i`.\n\n# Q96: Show a dual-alternative IF statement checking if age \u2265 18. Why use nested decisions?\n\n**A96**:\n\n    plaintextCopyEditif age >= 18 then\n        print(\"Adult\")\n    else\n        print(\"Minor\")\n    endif\n    \n\n* **Nested** decisions handle more complex branching, e.g., if age \u2265 18 then check if can vote.\n\n# Q97: What is desk checking, and how does it catch logic errors?\n\n**A97**:\n\n* Manually walking through pseudocode or code with sample inputs step by step.\n* Reveals logic flaws before actual compiling or running.\n\n# Q98: Outline pseudocode for compound interest given principal, rate, times per year, and time in years.\n\n**A98**:\n\n    plaintextCopyEditfunction compoundInterest(principal, rate, n, t)\n        \/\/ rate in decimal, e.g. 5% = 0.05\n        amount = principal * (1 + (rate\/n))^(n * t)\n        return amount\n    endfunction\n    \n\n# Q99: Why consider both time and space complexity when designing algorithms?\n\n**A99**:\n\n* **Time complexity** affects speed.\n* **Space complexity** affects memory usage.\n* Balancing them is crucial for efficient, feasible solutions.\n\n# Q100: How do you handle edge cases in pseudocode, and why are they often bug sources?\n\n**A100**:\n\n* Add checks: `if denominator == 0 then print(\"Error\") else do division`.\n* **Edge cases** break normal assumptions, so forgetting them causes unexpected crashes or incorrect results.","permalink":"\/r\/WGU_CompSci\/comments\/1jfvmzu\/introduction_to_computer_science_d684_study\/","created_utc":1742494840,"score":19,"text_length":26342,"vader_compound":0.9993,"course_code":"D684"}

{"post_id":"1jektyk","subreddit":"WGU_CompSci","title":"D686 Operating Systems For Computer Scientist OA Passed!","selftext":"I just finished taking the OA for D686, with this being a newer class but actually just an updated version of C191 Operation Systems I decided to do a little write up with what I choose to study and how the OA compares to the course quizzes and PA.\n\nTo start my main study was reading over the course material, there is a lot to read but it's well worth it. I personally enjoyed learning about the topics that is covered in this course and if you plan to do anything computer related it's really cool to learn about what is really happening behind all the clicks and typing lol (seriously tho the more you enjoy the content the easier it will be to retain the info). Overall the course material I found to be kind of a mess as there are a lot of instructor notes telling you to skip this section\/paragraph and pick back up at this section\/paragraph. I found this kind of annoying and could just simply remove the sections that are to be skipped. Also the sections seem to be out of order, they will talk about interrupts before giving you the definition of what an interrupt is or any other info about it then a few sections later they introduce interrupts like its the first time talking about it. This is how most of the course material is. Some of the sections will go real in depth about certain topics and after taking the OA I found that it's more generalized questions then real specific question about a topic, so don't be afraid of skimming sections that start doing math or equations as there wasn't a single question that related to an equation or had to do math. If I had to redo the course I personally would skim through the course material a lot faster then I did and read the summaries while making some flash cards for the definitions of the terms, reading every word for word seems a little overkill.\n\nNow onto the differences between the OA and PA and Course Material Quizzes.... The course material quizzes are a good quick thing to take but they did not relate to the OA in the slightest bit but did relate to the PA. So comes the PA, the PA seemed to be more focused questions on definitions then the OA was. The OA had very broad and generic questions that are relatively easy to get each question down to a 50\/50. I defiantly think I over studied for the class but that's alright since I got competent in all sections for the test and passed pretty well. If you have decent knowledge in computers\/technology like what RAM does, different memory storage devices do and things like that then overall the class should be pretty easy. If you have 0 experience with technology then the class will be very overwhelming for you and I recommend studying a bit more. I spent A LOT of time learning the different CPU scheduling algorithms and how they work and stuff but I did not get 1 question in regards to CPU scheduling besides a very generic question like (this is not an actual question just an example) \"what role does this component have in terms of CPU scheduling\" so like I said trying to learn every little detail of each topic is overkill and unnecessary. The first like 10 questions of the OA are over general things about computers and the average person using them (think like the first 1 or 2 sections of the reading cover this stuff) I was surprised by that and probably got a few of those wrong lol.\n\nThe instructor will send out an email with extra stuff to study like videos to watch, some other C191 stuff. For the most part I did not use these but did take a look at one of the youtube series that is linked in the email and got about half way through the series and then picked up on doing the readings, the videos are inline with what you will learn about in the reading and I definitely recommend giving them a watch. The video series I watches was by Tami Sorgente, that is the one I recommend watching (didn't check out the other videos tho). I do not think just the videos them self will get you through the OA unless you already have some technology knowledge.\n\nThe time I spent on the class was Started: 3\/5\/25, PA: 3\/17\/25, OA: 3\/18\/25. I spent about an hour or 2 on weekdays reading and then 1 saturday like 8 hours reading. Class took longer then I wanted to be was dreading reading as I hate reading lol but overall I think finishing this class in a week if doable. I hope this may of helped someone and if you got any questions comment and I'll try to help as best as I can!","permalink":"\/r\/WGU_CompSci\/comments\/1jektyk\/d686_operating_systems_for_computer_scientist_oa\/","created_utc":1742345042,"score":3,"text_length":4494,"vader_compound":0.9986,"course_code":"D686"}

{"post_id":"1j9oi3o","subreddit":"WGU_CompSci","title":"D288 Tips 2025","selftext":"Just wanted to post an update on D288 as of 3\/2025 since the project instructions have changed quite a bit over the years. I got my project returned with some super vague evaluator comments but after reading the course check off list (https:\/\/srm--c.vf.force.com\/apex\/CourseArticle?id=kA03x0000011e2rCAA&groupId=&searchTerm=&courseCode=D288&rtn=\/apex\/CommonsExpandedSearch) and about 500 different Reddit posts I was able to deduce what I needed. \n\nAlso wanted to address that in the check off list above it says: \u2022 IMPORTANT-as of 11\/2024, Angular appears to have upgraded its libraries. In the [Division.java](http:\/\/Division.java) entity, the front end also needs an additional constructor, as shown in [**Add Customer Form Fix**](https:\/\/wgu.hosted.panopto.com\/Panopto\/Pages\/Viewer.aspx?id=52d84340-5ac0-4463-896b-b2230009668a)public Division(String url) {\n\n[this.id](http:\/\/this.id) = Long.parseLong(url.substring(url.lastIndexOf('\/')+1));\n\n} i didnt end up even needing to put that code in but if you cant get your customers to save then maybe it will be useful... Theres also an instructor video showing exactly how\/where to add it in (https:\/\/wgu.hosted.panopto.com\/Panopto\/Pages\/Viewer.aspx?id=52d84340-5ac0-4463-896b-b2230009668a)\n\nAlso another thing that was super helpful which the instructor told us to do in the videos was to go into your [application.properties](http:\/\/application.properties) folder and change the last line to say `logging.level.org.springframework=DEBUG`as that will give you much more detailed error logs and help you debug a lot faster.\n\nFor part G(write validators etc.) remember you cant use external libraries so spring boot validation is a no go(@NotNull @ NotBlank etc.). Also you\u2019ll need to make sure your implementation code has a loop that makes sure the cart is 1. Not null 2. Not empty and 3. The cart items isnt empty\/null. of any of those are true, then also make sure it outputs a meaningful message saying something like cart cant be empty or whatever. You\u2019ll also need validation to make sure the party is not less than 1. Again, if it is, output a meaningful message.\n\nThe impl file itself was a hassle for me and I had to change the order of my code a million times so I\u2019ll stress that even if the code itself is perfect the order of the saving and getting and looping really does matter.\n\nAlso the versions I used for the project were Java 17, spring boot 3.3.6, and maven 3.8.1 (I had to change these multiple times and all the Reddit posts were saying to do different versions as well as the course checklist page itself)\u00a0Also be wary of some of the stuff in that checklist it says that part G isn\u2019t being evaluated anymore as of 4\/24 and that was just not accurate for me.\u00a0\n\nAlso another issue I was struggling with big time was my database just not connecting. I found one Reddit post comment that was my saving grace : \n\n[https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/WGU\\_CompSci\/comments\/168qz83\/comment\/lrbh26t\/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web3x&utm\\_name=web3xcss&utm\\_term=1&utm\\_content=share\\_button](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/WGU_CompSci\/comments\/168qz83\/comment\/lrbh26t\/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)\n\nI covered what tripped me up the most but if anyone has any questions please let me know and I\u2019ll be happy to help out where I can!!","permalink":"\/r\/WGU_CompSci\/comments\/1j9oi3o\/d288_tips_2025\/","created_utc":1741797942,"score":3,"text_length":2519,"vader_compound":0.9965,"course_code":"D288"}

I just passed the OA and wanted to share my thoughts in case it helps anyone.\n\n***A Bit About Me:*** I don\u2019t have professional experience in computer science, but I did competitive programming in the past. Also, a family member run a secondhand computer resale business, which gave me some understanding of computer components and how computers work.\n\n***Course Materials & Textbooks:*** The course is mostly based on Computer Science Illuminated (about 95% of the material), with some content from Programming Logic and Design and zyBook. Here\u2019s my take on each:\n\n* *Computer Science Illuminated*\n\nHonestly, I found this book frustrating. I usually take structured notes, and I expected a science textbook to be written in a clear, rigorous way\u2014kind of like a math book. But instead, this one has a more casual, conversational tone, which didn\u2019t work well for me.\n\nSome things that bugged me:\n\n* A lot of terms are explained in a way that feels too casual, making it harder to fully grasp concepts.\n* Instead of breaking down steps clearly and expressing them by bullet points, the book explains things in long paragraphs.\n* New concepts are introduced without clear connections to previous ones, so I often found myself wondering, *Why is this being mentioned now? How does it relate to what I just learned?*\n\nI relied on the vocabulary lists in the course modules (which had clearer definitions) and used ChatGPT to refine my notes. That helped me get a more structured understanding of the concepts.\n\n* *Programming Logic and Design*: I didn\u2019t spend much time on this one because it mostly covers programming, which I\u2019m already familiar with. I skimmed through it pretty quickly.\n* *zyBook:* I actually liked this one! It\u2019s written in a way that\u2019s both approachable and rigorous, making it easier to digest.\n\n***Additional Study Materials:*** The course provides chapter quizzes at the end of each module, as well as extra quizzes from the instructor. Just a heads-up\u2014the instructor\u2019s quizzes have quite a few errors. If you lose points on a question, double-check the answer, because chances are, you picked the correct one.\n\n***How I Studied***\n\nI only used the materials WGU provided\u2014no outside resources. My approach was pretty simple:\n\n* Took notes on key concepts.\n* Completed the quizzes from both the instructor and course modules.\n* Looked for patterns and connections between concepts.\n\nFor example, I noticed a lot of similarities between computer systems and networking. Both deal with:\n\n* Moving data (Bus vs. Packet Switching)\n* Controlling information flow (Control Unit vs. Router)\n* Ensuring correct execution (Program Counter vs. IP Address)\n\n***Exam Reflection***\n\nOne mistake I made was only focusing on the textbook and instructor quizzes. That meant I wasn\u2019t as familiar with the way questions were structured on the OA.\n\nI struggled the most with Module 2, which was the shortest module but caused the biggest loss in my exam score (as shown in the picture).\n\n***My Advice:*** If you\u2019re taking OA, I\u2019d recommend spending extra time on:\n\n* **Computer problem solving process**\n* **Software development lifecycle**\n* **Codes of ethics**\n\nPlease read the questions carefully to make sure you understand them.\n\nHope this helps! Feel free to ask if you have any questions.","permalink":"\/r\/WGU_CompSci\/comments\/1j94v7p\/d684_introduction_to_computer_science_review\/","created_utc":1741735475,"score":23,"text_length":3402,"vader_compound":0.9921,"course_code":"D684"}

{"post_id":"1i32d79","subreddit":"WGU_Finance","title":"Passed D366!!!!!","selftext":"I PASSED!!!\n\nHoly CRAP - I don't think I have ever been as happy and excited as I am right now.\n\nOkay, my experience:\n\nThis OA was significantly more challenging than the first. The questions and answers were all very much worded to trick you. A question asked about the Accounts Receivable Turnover ratio - I'm sure it is real, but I never saw it in either of the PAs, course material (and I read a lot of that book), or the Cohorts. That annoyed me greatly. I also think there were some questions with wrong answers, specifically some math ones. It was an EBIT\/EV ratio comparing years or something, and I would get the first part right but not the second. I think my answer was still right, but regardless, it was mildly frustrating.\n\nThis one had far less math, but knowing EV, P\/S, P\/E, EPS, FCF, PV, and sales per share is absolutely necessary. Know the business cycles - 5 or so questions on that. Only one on what size cap a company was. Knowing the valuation tools is also a must. Know more than just the formulas, but what they are and why they are used is absolutely necessary.\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/9v1l5kervfde1.png?width=861&format=png&auto=webp&s=e820cf57e2528dab5b45ae323be12f9fd665e5b3\n\nThe free cash flow questions always mess me up, and there were probably 3 or 4 of those - know and understand that.\n\nOther than that, it is similar to the last OA I took. As I said, this one was much harder. I am more than happy to chat with anyone about what I did to pass. I know it's not the BEST competency score, but a pass is a pass. :)\n\nYou can go through and take a look at other posts I've made & I've shared resources that I've made and used! :)","permalink":"\/r\/WGU_Finance\/comments\/1i32d79\/passed_d366\/","created_utc":1737069624,"score":15,"text_length":1572,"vader_compound":0.8519,"course_code":"D366"}
{"post_id":"1i25wm0","subreddit":"WGU_Finance","title":"My D366 OA Experience ","selftext":"I posted last week that I would take the OA on Wednesday, the 8th. Long story short, I didn't pass, but I was very close. \n\n\\*Short Version\\*\n\nNot remembering the Price-to-Sales ratio really hurt me; there were 5 or 6 questions on this. Know the Enterprise Value Formula - quite a few questions on that and EBIT\/EV. Understand Cash Flows to Net Income and the relationship between the cash flow activities and Net Income to Cash Flows to operations. Knowing the 3 financial statements are & what is on each is an absolute must-know. You have 3 hours to take this test. Use it. Use your whiteboard to break down the questions; the questions are long and wordy; break them down and really figure out what you're being asked. \n\n\\*Long Version\\*\n\nSo Wednesday, the 8th, rolls around, and I'm getting ready to take my OA. About 20 minutes before my exam started, I went to do a system check, but something wasn't quite right. It said I needed to allow guardian browser access to my mic and camera. No matter how many times I allowed this, turned it off and on, all the sort - I couldn't get it to work. I had taken 14 OAs at that point and never had a problem, so honestly, I thought it was just a fluke in the system. I went on to take my exam, and that's when everything spiraled downhill. I was able to do all the checks, but for some reason, it would freeze and shut down when I would go to take a picture of myself and my ID. I went through 4\/5 proctors and 3 technicians. None of them could figure out what was going on. As we approached the 2nd hour of going through the same 5 steps, I told them to forget about it and that I would reschedule the test for tomorrow. After getting off with them, I called assessment services, and they solved the problem in maybe 20 minutes - there was an update on my computer that had changed some of the permissions on my computer settings. The proctors didn't check that, and I don't know enough about it to check there myself - a total headache, LOL. So, the next day, Thursday, I'm getting ready to take the OA. The system checks work, and practice exams with a proctor worked, so I felt good. However, when I got to take the actual exam, they said they couldn't see me or my screen - they had to work on it a bit, but after a half hour or so, I was FINALLY able to get into the exam. \n\nFirst, I wrote the EV, ROCE, EPS, and PV formulas. I forgot the P\/S and P\/E formulas - this hurt me. I also wrote down the 3 financial statements and what each one has. This took me about 5 minutes. I then went through question to question; writing down what I was being asked to find, and the details from the question, and finally A-D to do process of selection. I think this is necessary for this OA. Most of the questions were pretty wordy, and if you didn't read it carefully, there was always an answer that looked right at first glance, but once you ACTUALLY read it, you would see it was something else. \n\nAll was going good, until my family came back home unexpectedly. I was only on question 10 at this point. They were super loud, and it really threw me off; they had just forgotten that I was taking my exam; I should have reminded them. That's on me. I had to re-read questions 5 or 6 times, and I still wouldn't understand just because I was distracted. Things quieted down by question 25, and I got into a good groove again, but that's when I got hit with the P\/E and P\/S questions and just straight-up guessed and moved on. Between the 2 formulas, there were +\/- 8 questions. Not remembering these formulas HURT. \n\nBy question 50, I was BURNT out. My brain physically hurt. I continued to write down what I was being asked, details, and A-D; again, this helped, but it does make the process WAY longer. In total, I had 80 questions - with 10 added in at any point that wouldn't be graded. I've had that before, but something just ground my gears about it specifically for this course. It took 2 hours and 54 minutes to complete the exam. Finished with 6 minutes remaining. \n\nOverall, I didn't find it extremely challenging once you broke down the question. I felt confident while taking it - minus being distracted by family - and I still feel confident now. The plan now is to take my second attempt on the 16th. If you go to previous posts I've made, I've linked flashcards I've made, as well as a matching game on Canva. Both of these have helped me. If there is a concept you don't know, search for it on Investopedia. The explanations are much easier to comprehend there.\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/jx69d7jao7de1.png?width=871&format=png&auto=webp&s=156eebb996df0346c53bf500eb1135ad26418f12\n\n","permalink":"\/r\/WGU_Finance\/comments\/1i25wm0\/my_d366_oa_experience\/","created_utc":1736970239,"score":3,"text_length":4545,"vader_compound":0.9809,"course_code":"D366"}

{"post_id":"1hyhoqi","subreddit":"WGU_Finance","title":"How To Pass D366 Financial Statement Analysis","selftext":"Okay considering how badly this course is currently put together I will quickly write this guide so everyone can pass the OA. Now this won't be how to pass the quickest but if you do have endless time to put towards study it is possible to pass using this method in just a week or two.\n\nFirstly when starting the course I would complete this [Udemy Course](https:\/\/wgu.udemy.com\/course\/accounting-fsa-a-solid-foundation-for-a-career-in-finance\/learn\/lecture\/5518226?start=79#overview) which I will also link below (Udemy is **100% FREE** for WGU Students - if this link isn't to a free course please comment below and I'll show you how to access if for free). This course is about 3 hours long and will give you a pretty good guide and explanation over most of the course.\n\nAfter completing the Udemy I would **STRONGLY** recommend watching through this [Edspira Playlist](https:\/\/youtube.com\/playlist?list=PL_KGEFWqEaTBG_cHPL9omTIiltYQ6-Wu_&si=mQ57xzFVEugmrqeZ) on YouTube which I will also link below. Watch every single video in this in the order it is set up. Honestly speaking these Edspira videos are probably the best resource I can give you for this course.\n\nNow I also recommend you attend Mr. Borg's morning Cohorts if you are able. If you aren't able email him and ask for a copy for the recordings (He actively updates his Cohorts the more he learns about the test and what helps us to pass). He holds these Cohorts about every 2 weeks so just try and attend or get a copy of his recording at any point (sooner the better). Just so everyone is clear at the time of me writing this the Cohorts DO NOT show up on the courses homepage so the only way to attend or to get a copy of them is to reach out to the Mr. Borg personally. Most of the topics he covers will appear on the test.\n\nAt this point I recommend you take the PA (Keep in mind there are quite a few questions just out right incorrect on the PA's most of them being the math part). When you take the PA the first time I recommend you take it with a Formula List from your notes. Once you finish the PA check to see what topics you are struggling on then I recommend seeing if there is an Edspira video for that topic and if there is rewatch it. If there isn't then I think you should find and read that part in the course material (If you don't like reading or have a hard time concentrating there is a robot voice reader that you can listen to). Also heads up there are 2 distinct PA's for this class and questions from both show up on the test (so do this for both of them).\n\nOnce you finish your review I recommend completing the Assessments for each Lesson Topic in the in the course material. I personally feel like most of the test questions bank come from these assessments and the PA's. Once you finish the lesson assessments move onto the 3 Section Assessments. Now if you feel like this is too much or you have a solid grasp on everything already I still would Strongly recommend you do The Assessment for Section 3. The Section 3 Assessment covers Valuations which is a third of the OA. Also we don't get many opportunities to practice on Valuations in this course so make sure you get all the practice you can before the OA.\n\nAt this point if you haven't already take both PA's again until you pass and try your best to remember some of the questions and answers (considering some of them will show back up on the OA).\n\nNow for the OA. When you start make sure you come into it will all the tools they let you use (i.e. a  financial calculator and a whiteboard). When you start make sure to data dump the formulas on your whiteboard or type them as a note on the test (that way you don't have to waste time trying to remember them when you see them at the very end of the test).\n\n**Topics that are important to learn and remember for the OA.** For the math portion understanding Terminal Value and Present Value of FCF is important. Also make sure you read the question and know if you a supposed to be solving for debt or equity. P\/S Ratio will show up a bit so make sure you understand that and know the formula. Make sure you understand the different financial statement especially The  Statement of Cash Flows. Learn what Vertical & Horizontal Analysis is and how they work. Know how to solve for EBIT\/EV & EV\/EBIT (also with EBITDA). You should know that a higher EBIT\/EV is good (a way to remember it is EBIT and good both have 4 letters) and know that a high EV\/EBIT is bad. Understand why a company would engage in Upward and Downward Earnings Management. Finally I would say you need to make sure you know about a Firm's Life Cycle (Intro, Growth, Maturity, & Decline) and know how Cash Flows and Net Income are affected in each stage.\n\nFollow this and you should be able to pass D366. Good luck to all of y'all and I hope you pass.\n\n\n\np.s. schedule a meeting with the course instructor before taking the OA and see if he can offer you tips or help you review anything you might be worried about.\n\n**SUMMARY: Watch** [**Udemy**](https:\/\/wgu.udemy.com\/course\/accounting-fsa-a-solid-foundation-for-a-career-in-finance\/learn\/lecture\/5518226?start=79#overview)**, Watch** [**Edspira**](https:\/\/youtube.com\/playlist?list=PL_KGEFWqEaTBG_cHPL9omTIiltYQ6-Wu_&si=Uq8BClqNHc6uSk2L)**, & Attend Cohort**\n\nEDIT: I forgot to put this in here but if you don't understand a question on the PA or you aren't sure if it is correct put it into ChatGPT and it will explain to you how to do it and what it thinks the answer is (understand ChatGPT isn't perfect and can be wrong sometimes).\n\n**LINKS:**  \n[https:\/\/wgu.udemy.com\/course\/accounting-fsa-a-solid-foundation-for-a-career-in-finance\/learn\/lecture\/5518226?start=79#overview](https:\/\/wgu.udemy.com\/course\/accounting-fsa-a-solid-foundation-for-a-career-in-finance\/learn\/lecture\/5518226?start=79#overview)\n\n[https:\/\/youtube.com\/playlist?list=PL\\_KGEFWqEaTBG\\_cHPL9omTIiltYQ6-Wu\\_&si=Uq8BClqNHc6uSk2L](https:\/\/youtube.com\/playlist?list=PL_KGEFWqEaTBG_cHPL9omTIiltYQ6-Wu_&si=Uq8BClqNHc6uSk2L)","permalink":"\/r\/WGU_Finance\/comments\/1hyhoqi\/how_to_pass_d366_financial_statement_analysis\/","created_utc":1736550305,"score":22,"text_length":5126,"vader_compound":0.999,"course_code":"D366"}

Here are my scores from the PA, and I will update you when I take my OA on the 1st or 2nd.\n\nAs for people who struggle with retaining a bunch of information, these are the key takeaways on the PA (could be different than the OA; I will update you when I know). One part that surprised me about the PA was that it mentioned Performance Evaluation more than I thought it would because it was barely skimmed over in the course material. However, it is mostly common sense.\n\nBehavioral influences are 17% of the PA (hopefully the same for OA, again I'll update after). This really went over **Self Evaluation, Perception, Value (terminal\/Instrumental), Intrinsic & Extrinsic reward, Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory, Equity theory**, **Goal-setting theory of motivation,**\n\nGroup Development is 19% of PA, and this went over the **Structural Elements of a Group (Roles, norms, status, size, cohesiveness, diversity), organization's structure,** \u00a0**conflict resolution technique, and Social loafing.**\n\nTeams and Team Building - 26% of PA, and this went over **Work teams (in general), Types of teams (Virtual team, Cross-functional team, Self-management, Problem-solving), and common characteristics of effective teams.** Honestly, most of the questions about how to help a team be more efficient were common sense, and you just had to apply the knowledge you already have about how the teams function and how to solve conflict.\n\nOrganizational Culture - 14% of PA, this went over **organizational culture**, **the six primary characteristics that define an organization\u2019s culture, Socialization process, Culture Transmission, when can culture be dysfunctional, and strong organizational culture.**\n\nLeadership - 14% of PA, this went over **Leadership types, contingency theories (all of them, not just Fiedler), and**\u00a0**conflict-resolution techniques.**\n\nPerformance Evaluation - 10% of PA, this went over\u00a0the **relationship between performance evaluation and motivation**, **Purpose for Performance Evaluations. and 360-degree performance evaluations.**","permalink":"\/r\/WGU_Finance\/comments\/1gfmkrv\/c715_organizational_behavior\/","created_utc":1730295057,"score":6,"text_length":2746,"vader_compound":0.9865,"course_code":"C715"}

{"post_id":"1b0wm4m","subreddit":"WGU_Finance","title":"C717 - Business Ethics","selftext":"I watched this guy today on YouTube talking about his experience with this class. I copied the transcript and this is what he said....\n\nA few tips that will help you on your journey. So basically with this one it's very straightforward and honestly it should be really simple if you just read the Task sheets that they give you. When I initially took this, I definitely went in the wrong direction and wrote a whole paper based off of the initial scenario prompt they gave me, and I failed both Task 1 and Task 2 and I was kind of thrown for a loop for a week. But after meeting with the course instructor, she really broke it down and as simple as possible. You're not writing an essay with this one, you are just answering the question, so on this paper just put \u201cA1 - question\u201d and then underneath put your response to that question.\n\nI thought that personally you had to go use the scenario for each situation, but all they're asking for is to answer the questions (short and concisely) and don\\&#39;t try to over complicate it like I did. I spent a whole weekend trying to type out these two masterful papers when in reality it was just, \u201cwhat's the question, write it down, and then put an answer beneath it\u201d.\n\nWith that being said, I don't think you need to go through the course materials or the course chatter. That honestly confused me a little bit with that stuff, so for this one, just go through the task sheet that you get emailed and once you start the course, work off of that and just answer it.\n\nThe best way to do it is, I had the PDF open in one browser and then I had my Word document open in the other and I just read off of both pages and answered everything you can. If you don't know something, just Google it or quote it and be sure you source it and you should be good. This course is really straightforward, and I think it's a good one. There's a lot of things to learn in Business Ethics.","permalink":"\/r\/WGU_Finance\/comments\/1b0wm4m\/c717_business_ethics\/","created_utc":1708990611,"score":6,"text_length":1953,"vader_compound":0.9598,"course_code":"C717"}

{"post_id":"1az1k2g","subreddit":"WGU_Finance","title":"D362 - Corporate Finance","selftext":"  \n\n(From 5 months ago) I just finished the OA for D362 in the Exemplary range and wanted to offer my thoughts and advice to help everyone be successful. Note: As I'm typing this there are still no prerecorded cohorts or video lessons by the course instructors to go back through and watch in order to learn the material from.\n\nFirst and foremost, have a financial calculator such as the TI BA II Plus and learn how to use it. Then get comfortable with Time Value of Money calculations and Cashflow Operations as it's a major part of this course.\n\nWith how new the class is the course materials are a little bit of a mess and the in-lesson assessments aren't put together perfectly. There are a few typos and situations where the correct answer is based off a question that wasn't asked. But it's easy to work around these, the biggest value to the assessments in my opinion was to allow you to learn the formulas.\n\nThat said, in my opinion the course material does not fully prepare you for the OA. Having done every assessment in the course materials, there was still new topics that I came across in the pre-assessment and then again in the OA. But combined with the readings it gave a solid base of knowledge, but not enough to make me comfortable leaving it as is.\n\nMy advice is to use the pre-assessment to tell you what you still need to read more about. This was where I came across Trade-off\/ Pecking-order theory.\n\nMake sure you understand your Time Value of Money, Cashflow Operations, WACC, CAPM, Constant Growth, Operating Leverage, EAY, and when to apply what formulas based off of what information you have. But despite the number of different formulas and concepts you don't need to overcomplicate matters, as you usually only have the information to use one formula at any given time.\n\nIn my opinion the pre-assessment was only somewhat representative of the OA. But it had enough similarities that if you did good on one you would probably do good on the other. But that said the OA is more conceptual and asks more questions regarding \"Why.\"\n\nI spent roughly 28 hours on this course over two and a half days.\n\n(From 3 months ago) This was the first course I struggled with in the entire program for BS Finance. The PA and OA were much different. The broad topics covered were similar, but the detail in the questions varied wildly.\n\nIn contrast to OP's comment at the end of his post, I didn't get many \"why\" questions, just a handful. It was mostly calculations. You need to be able to read the question, understand what it's asking you, know what formula to use, and how to punch them into your financial calculator. Bond pricing, Time Value of Money, Cash Flows, PV, NPV, etc.\n\nI took one PA, did well. Then brushed up on my formulas and calculations. Passed on the first OA attempt, but I'm sure it was close. I wasn't expecting some of the questions, or some of the values it was asking me to find. I felt very unpracticed on what it was asking, because it was different from the OA.\n\nMy suggestion is to use the PA as your study guide, take the entire 3 hours. Use outside resources to help find answers. I found the course material to be completely unhelpful. Then take another PA, see if you get some different questions. If you do well on two PA's, go for your OA.","permalink":"\/r\/WGU_Finance\/comments\/1az1k2g\/d362_corporate_finance\/","created_utc":1708799320,"score":8,"text_length":3319,"vader_compound":0.9932,"course_code":"D362"}

{"post_id":"188iy5x","subreddit":"WGU_HHS","title":"Health and Human Services tips and advice for PA submissions","selftext":"Good morning everyone,\n\nI am hoping to create a guide for others working through this program. I I just completed the new program on November 2023. I am planning to make more in depth posts for the harder classes but wanted to share some general advice. \n\n\nWhen working on a PA I found it\u2019s best to copy and paste scenario into a word document. Below that, copy each rubric topic and leave some space for your answer. \n\nWork through each rubric one at a time. The papers usually do not need to be in an essay format, just make sure you are clearly labeling each part of the rubric. I included a sample from D268 to use as a guide\n\n\nA1:INTERPERSONAL COMMUNICATION BEHAVIOR\n\nFor each character (i.e., Raymond & Jenna) you observed in the video, identify 1 or 2 interpersonal communication behaviors that escalated the conflict.\n\n\nA1A:DESCRIPTION OF BEHAVIORS\n\nDescribe how each of the identified behaviors in prompt A1 escalated the conflict.\n\nA2:ALTERNATIVE COMMUNICATION BEHAVIORS\n\nFor each of the interpersonal communication behaviors identified in prompt A1, provide an alternative communication behavior that could have been used to de-escalate the conflict.\n\n\nA2A:DESCRIPTION OF ALTERNATIVE COMMUNICATION BEHAVIORS\n\n\nDescribe how each of the identified behaviors in prompt A2 could have been used to de-escalate the conflict.\n\n\nB:CONFLICT NEGOTIATION RECOMMENDATION\n\nRecommend how each of the characters in the video (i.e., Raymond & Jenna) could have spoken or behaved differently to manage and resolve the conflict by specifically addressing each of the 5 steps of negotiation listed below:\n\u2022  pre-negotiation\n\u2022  opening\n\u2022  exploration\n\u2022  bargaining\n\u2022  agreement\n\n\nInclude an additional reference page \n\nTaking a few minutes to set up your paper will keep you organized and make the assignment easier to tackle. It will also ensure you don\u2019t miss anything needed for a passing grade. \n\nDon\u2019t overthink the PA. Keep your solutions simple and don\u2019t do more work than what is asked for in the rubric. \n\nChatGPT can be controversial, but it is very helpful when looking for guidance on these tasks. You can copy and paste a scenario into ChatGPT and it will give you some general ideas on solutions. It will not give you any specific resources. I use the information it gave me to look for some sources I could use. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THAT YOU COPY AND PASTE DIRECTLY FROM CHATGPT. But it can be very useful when you are just stuck or need some brainstorming ideas. Take advantage of it.\n\nEXAMPLE\n\nMs. Jones is a homeless 33 year-old African American mother of 3 children under 18. She was recently diagnosed with HIV. Ms. Jones has a history of IV drug use. She is still currently using drugs. She dropped out of HS in 11th grade and has a history of mental illness. She is cautious about starting drug therapy due to stories of other African Americans being used in experimental trials without consent. She has not expressed these concerns to her provider. \n\nIdentify two entities or organizations within health and human services that would assist Ms. Jones.\n\nEnter this info into ChatGPT and it will give you several organizations. Do a web search to find the official site for these sources, make sure it\u2019s a good fit for this family, and get your info from the sites. \n\nDon\u2019t forget to properly cite in your paper. In text should look like (Syringe Services Program, 2019).  \n\nChatGPT can help with any scenario and give tips on how to communicate with clients based on their specific needs, what resources would be helpful, how to create goals for clients, and how to follow up. Use it as a guide but it\u2019s important to also use the course material and textbook to ensure you don\u2019t miss key points. \n\nYou can usually start your next course once all the PAs have been submitted. You don\u2019t need to wait for them to be graded. If you are starting a course on the weekend or when your mentor is off, you can text student services to add your next class. The number is 385-985-2645. They usually addd the course very quickly. \n\nIf you are looking for advice on any specific task feel free to leave a comment.","permalink":"\/r\/WGU_HHS\/comments\/188iy5x\/health_and_human_services_tips_and_advice_for_pa\/","created_utc":1701455595,"score":17,"text_length":4141,"vader_compound":0.9948,"course_code":"D268"}

{"post_id":"1jy7lp3","subreddit":"WGU_MBA","title":"C213 Accounting for Decision Makers ADVICE","selftext":"I just passed the OA with Exemplary in all the sections for C213 after trying to go through the class about 5 months ago, not understanding the content, getting busy with life, and not finishing after about 3 chapters. Here is my advice:\n\nDon't go through the financial statements in the order! I got too much information mixed up the first time and couldn't master them individually. Instead, I went through the introduction to financial statements, and after I finished the section about the Balance Sheets, I cut to the Balance Sheet chapter, and went through that. Then, I went back and did the intro to Income Statements, and then did the chapter, same with the Statement of Cash Flows. This helped me really master each financial statement on its own, and made my learning go more smoothly. \n\nI also watched all the videos, and did all of the end of chapter quizzes. With the quizzes, if I missed any questions, I used ChatGPT to take me step by step through the question and explain it to me. It really worked well, as long as I included what the answer should be.  A few times I didn't include the answers or tell it the right answer and ChatGPT gave me the wrong question. \n\nLastly, I did the PA on the same day I did the OA. I did the PA in the morning and reviewed the questions I got wrong a little bit right away, then I took a break, and came back later, reviewed the questions more and did the OA. The PA and OA are VERY similar, in fact I'm pretty sure I had duplicate questions on the OA, or at least they were so similar that I was able to pull from memory how to do them. \n\nOverall, I also found looking through Reddit and the Discord pages helped to boost my confidence, I was very worried about this class after failing last time. I am happy to say that the class isn't that bad.

I'm in the final stretch of this course and it's been quite a journey for me as I've been digging into all sorts of steps and software I'm unaware of. I think I'm in the very last piece and wanted some quick advice on what the best route is to deploy. For reference -\n\nI've setup and run all code, have everything committed to Git, the pipeline is successfully running, and I have a Docker Image file and URL. My question is what is realistically the easiest next step to finish the Rubric and push the API to be live to test a few things for the Panopto video? I've seen several different options, but each time I try to dig into one I get in the weeds, so what is the best route everyone found?\n\n\\- Use Docker on local machine? (I'm getting weird errors and failing due to WSL)\n\n\\- Use GitLab's environment (My understanding is I need to modify my .yaml even more to include a deployment step?)\n\n\\- Use Google Cloud Run? (I was signing up for and enabling all sorts of steps I had no clue what it was doing here)\n\n\\- Use Railway? (Allegedly a very easy method to do this, but I couldn't find native GitLab support .\n\nEssentially, does anyone have advice on where to turn for this very last step before I write my paper and close the books on this class?

So, I started this thread for people to share their wins and how they approached completing the class, retaining knowledge, and passing the exam.\n\nAs I am new to WGU, it was a trial-and-error process figuring out how to organize study notes as I read through the material and what to retain from the content.\n\n**My process this time around:**\n\n* **Engaged with the Material:** I read through the course material and actively engaged with the content, discussing the concepts I was learning with friends or anyone who would listen. I paid close attention to the key takeaways outlined in the coursework.\n* **Took the Pretest:** Before reviewing, I took the pretest to identify areas I needed to focus on.\n* **Searched for Flashcards:** I looked for flashcards made by previous students on Quizlet to see if anyone had already built a set (with mediocre results).\n* **Created Custom Flashcards:** Using what flashcards I could find, I built my own for the areas where I needed the most practice. I skimmed the source material for these topics and used ChatGPT to generate flashcards from the key components.\n* **Utilized Quizlet:** I imported the flashcards from ChatGPT into Quizlet (Quizlet Premium would make this process easier).\n* **Focused Study:** I studied the flashcards for the areas I struggled with the most in the pretest, along with flashcards covering the core material of the course as a whole.\n\nPlease feel free to share your experience with this class and any challenges you're running into!\n\n","permalink":"\/r\/WGU_Psychology\/comments\/1glxcw9\/just_completed_wgu_theories_of_personality_d564\/","created_utc":1731004084,"score":16,"text_length":1862,"vader_compound":0.9853,"course_code":"D564"}

{"post_id":"1k6cq0f","subreddit":"wgu_devs","title":"MSSWE, DevOps Engineering - D777 Real Life Applications of Data Structures - Task 1, PASSED","selftext":"* Degree: Master of Science in Software Engineering, DevOps Engineering (MSSWE)\n* Class: D777 Real Life Applications of Data Structures\n* Class Type: Performance Assessment (PA)\n   * *Note: PA has 2 parts*\n* Passed Task 1 on 1st submission\n\n**Overview**\n\nThis class covers using data structures for building software, but more so using existing libraries for the data structures instead of coding them yourself. The class only has a PA and the PA has two tasks. This post covers Task 1 for the PA.\n\nTask 1 is writing a paper discussing which data structures and Python libraries to use for a Warehouse logistics company to create inventory and order management software for them.\n\n*Important to note: Task 1s description provides a set of business requirements that you must keep in mind while writing the paper for each section of the rubric*\n\n**Estimated Time**\n\n* I completed writing the PA in 1 day, although I did spend a few days going through the course material\n\n**Task 1 Requirements**\n\n1. **Section A:** You're selecting x number of data structures that could be used for this inventory and order warehouse management application that can meet the business requirements\n   1. Advice: Refer to the course material because it covers the different data structures and algorithms in depth\n   2. Tip: Refer to the table of the different data structures in *\"Chapter 13 - Data Structures Libraries, Section 13.2 Data Structures Comparisons\"*\n2. **Section B:** You're comparing (i.e. space\/time complexities, trade offs, how they meet the business requirements, etc...) the data structures that you selected in Section A; and you recommend the best data structures to use out of the ones you identified in Section A, which you justify using empirical data and theoretical analysis\n   1. Tip: Refer to the table of the different data structures in *\"Chapter 13 - Data Structures Libraries, Section 13.2 Data Structures Comparisons\"*. This table goes over the different time\/space complexities for the data structures\n   2. For the empirical data to justify my data structure recommendation I searched for articles of companies using the data structure in their software\n   3. *Note: You can also refer to each Chapter for the data structures, specifically the time and space complexity part*\n3. **Section C:** You're selecting from a list of Python libraries WGU provides to use to implement the data structures you selected in Section B\n   1. Idk if in this section we were supposed to only select libraries for the recommended data structures in Section B, or all of the data structures you proposed in Section A. I ended up selecting Python libraries for all of the data structures I called out in Section A\n   2. *Note: The course material covers some of the libraries*\n\n**Notes**\n\n1. Constantly keep referring to the business requirements in the \"Scenario\" section while you're answering each section of the rubric\n2. I'd recommend referring to *\"Chapter 14 - Combining Data Structures in Problem Solving\"* if you wanted an idea of how to approach Task 1\n3. Don\u2019t overthink things too much. I was overthinking Task 1 at first, then decided to keep it simple and see if my PA passes\n\n**Side Notes**\n\n* Just like for the bachelors I did at WGU, I copy\/pasted each section from the rubric into my paper and just answered the questions for each section\u00a0\n* My paper only has 1 paragraph lol. All of the rest is tables or bullet points touching on each section of the rubric requirements","permalink":"\/r\/wgu_devs\/comments\/1k6cq0f\/msswe_devops_engineering_d777_real_life\/","created_utc":1745448300,"score":5,"text_length":3560,"vader_compound":0.9769,"course_code":"D777"}

{"post_id":"1ix8208","subreddit":"wgu_devs","title":"D280 done and dusted!","selftext":"I'm not gonna lie; I was worried about this class reading through the Reddit posts about this class. I am confident with my Javascript knowledge, but I have never used Angular before, so I wasn't sure how this was going to play out. As all the previous posts mention, this class should be reframed as an Angular class by the amount of information it requires you to learn. I started the class officially on 2\/10 and got my pass this morning. I did have to do one resubmission, but that's on me from taking advice from previous Reddits. So since most of the posts are a few months old, I figured I would share my perspective on things.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n\\- The Udemy Angular class offered through the course resources was a great starting point and provided most of the necessary information for setting up a large portion of the assignment\n\n\\- I'm not gonna lie figuring out the SVG and API was the most aggravating for me. I spent way longer than I would care to admit trying to incorporate the SVG file. I will say what others say is to inspect the code of the map and then play around from there.\n\n\\- For the API, I got so stuck on thinking in my brain that I needed an API Key like I'm used to that I stumped for a minute. It just reinforced to me how important it is to read the documentation of whatever API you're going to be using. This would have saved me a ton of headache if I hadn't thought that I knew what I was doing.\n\n\\- Routing was a pain to figure out not even going to lie. I gave up at one point and saw a Reddit post where someone had mentioned they didn't include it and still passed so I figured I would shoot my shot. I was horribly wrong and it was literally the only thing that caused my first submission to get sent back. I will say the course resources provided on routing leave out some important information that makes the routing kinda work, but not the way it's supposed to. I ended up looking up YouTube videos to figure it out and finally got it to work.\n\n\\- I've seen a fair number of posts where individuals say they look at others' GitHub repos to see what they did, and while that is a great way to learn, I would also offer a slight cautionary warning. Make sure you're actively learning from that and not just copying and pasting. You don't know what version they used or what code is doing what function, and it may not necessarily work in your code. Then you're just staring at unworking code, confused because you don't know what it's supposed to be doing in the first place. So make sure you're actually learning the code at its base level and not just trying to get out of this course so you can move on and be like those other students with 70+ credits in a term.\n\nOverall, this course project isn't incredibly difficult, especially if you already know Javascript. It's just learning the little nuances of Angular, and trying to find the correct information can be aggravating. I know a lot of people complain sometimes about the resources provided or the books not having enough info, but honestly, that's something that I like. It forces me to go out and find the information myself, and that's a lot of what being a Software Engineer will be about. From someone who has done this in some capacity for the last few years, 9 times out of 10, my first 2-3 days of a new project are googling information about what I'm doing and figuring out what others have learned and moving from there.\n\nBest of luck to you all starting this course, and remember, you can do it! If you start to get frustrated, take a break, go for a walk, and get a snack! Just do something to remove your brain from the problem, and you'll be surprised at how quickly you get your breakthrough moment there! :)","permalink":"\/r\/wgu_devs\/comments\/1ix8208\/d280_done_and_dusted\/","created_utc":1740419215,"score":8,"text_length":3752,"vader_compound":0.9909,"course_code":"D280"}

I mainly used this Reddit post to guide me; [https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/WGU\/comments\/1fntvp5\/summary\\_ethics\\_in\\_technology\\_d333\\_passed\\_in\\_8\\_days\/](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/WGU\/comments\/1fntvp5\/summary_ethics_in_technology_d333_passed_in_8_days\/) I did not complete the study guide as it was quite time-consuming.

{"post_id":"1k25i63","subreddit":"WGU","title":"Passed D333","selftext":"Just completed D333. Took me around 2 months(procrastination and 2 failed attempts).This class is not difficult its a matter of taking your time and actually reading through the question and what its asking you. Also in each question there is a keyword that is usually an indicator to what the correct answer is(this specific tip works best on the questions about laws and ethics ).\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/oox536zsklve1.png?width=633&format=png&auto=webp&s=9633aff1a1094570b7027c65361c329455e73104\n\n Another thing is once you have the laws and ethical frameworks memorized, you know about 50% - 60% of the OA. Another part of the OA that I struggled a lot on is around questions 40-60 they begin asking you questions on a lot of obscure things. The CI's will tell you that the OA is mostly laws, but fail to mention(not their fault since they don't have access to the OA) the more obscure things like what is a reasonable professional, or what is considered negligence etc. Ensure you know AI bias, E-discovery, proxy bias etc. Also the OA asks about the software engineering code of ethics as well as IT code of ethics. Please ensure you know the PAPA model and the CIA triad. There will be at least 3 questions about them. Further more.I remember there was a question regarding an IT manager taking on a project and the client kept asking for more features which increased scope creep. There was also a question that is along the lines of 'A user is selling a product on an e-commerce website and he fails to mention and test if the product works' in this question you have to think about if they this is fraud, misrepresentation, breach of contract etc.(Not giving out what the answer is but this WILL be a question that shows up but don't stress it too much.) \n\nHere are some study resources: \n\n[quizlet](https:\/\/quizlet.com\/784187648\/wgu-d333-ethics-in-technology-wgu-flash-cards\/) with over 300 terms \n\n[PDF](https:\/\/drive.google.com\/file\/d\/1vqHCZYMgKoKTQF4IXGoldfk_8aI8JaYq\/view?pli=1) of the laws\n\nAll [powerpoints](https:\/\/srm--c.vf.force.com\/apex\/CourseArticle?id=kA03x0000011e81CAA)\n\nChapter summary [study doc](https:\/\/srm--c.vf.force.com\/servlet\/servlet.FileDownload?retURL=https%3A%2F%2Fsrm--c.vf.force.com%2Fapex%2FFDP%2FCommonsExpandedChatter%3Fcode%3DD333&file=00PS600000EaPuJMAV&_CONFIRMATIONTOKEN=VmpFPSxNakF5TlMwd05DMHlNVlF4TXpvME5UbzFOUzQwTWpWYSxqNzVFaG8wcExjaThuYUpyZmRRbjUyUVhuQlZtdFA1R0xhQ1dzU1VDLXZnPSxZVEJoTmpobQ%3D%3D&common.udd.actions.ActionsUtilORIG_URI=%2Fservlet%2Fservlet.FileDownload) (can be found in course chatter)\n\nAlso I recommend speaking with your course instructor and having them provide you with a practice test. The practice test they provide will be worded completely different from the way the OA does(for the most part), but what it helps with is getting you in the mindset of reading the questions thoroughly and looking for keywords that indicate the BEST choice. There will be a lot of questions on the OA that seem correct, but are not the BEST choice(weird I know but the course instructors will explain).\n\nOne last tip that helped me is that all the study resources such as the PowerPoints, study doc, and laws pdf, I put them into Google's NotebookLM and asked it questions about the material. It helped me a lot. \n\n  \nSorry if this is all over the place but reach out if you have questions.\n\n TL;DR: Please ensure that once you memorize the laws and ethics DO NOT neglect the information in the course about the smaller things.","permalink":"\/r\/WGU\/comments\/1k25i63\/passed_d333\/","created_utc":1744984473,"score":13,"text_length":2714,"vader_compound":0.959,"course_code":"D333"}

I\u2019m hoping this eases someone else\u2019s fear. \n\nOriginally I tried to read the textbook and got bored, I also tried to watch the cohorts and could not stand them. So what I did to study was study definitions for the class on Quizlet, I chose a Quizlet with about 350 definitions and started the \u201clearn feature\u201d, once I felt I knew the definitions I found a Quizlet with all of the unit test questions plus additional questions. I also used the \u201clearn\u201d feature for this, and if I did not understand or got it wrong I would put it into ChatGPT and asked for an explanation on why the other options were incorrect. For the excel portion I used the unit 3 test and watched the videos in the test on how to enter the information. This was enough for me to learn what I needed to do in excel. Once I felt I had a good understanding, I took the PA, passed it and went straight into the OA. The questions were different, but I would say it isn\u2019t as dramatic of a difference as everyone else says. The excel portion was the same as the OA, just with different numbers.\n\nThis class was much easier than I expected. In total I probably studied about 12-15 hours.

{"post_id":"1jyelbj","subreddit":"WGU","title":"D545 GUIDE","selftext":"Hello just wanted to make a post showcasing my method on how I passed this annoying class in 4 days.\n\nFirst I started by immediately taking the pre-assessment to see where I would land with just using common sense and past knowledge from other classes etc.\n\nI got about 5-6 questions under passing. Then I used all the quizlets that people recommended, here is a link to all of them put together so its not confusing trying to find them, [Quizlets](https:\/\/quizlet.com\/user\/wguh000\/folders\/d545?i=1v1wx4&x=1xqt)\n\nI then went through and studied using the learn feature on the section 1 glossary quizlet then would go into the course material and did all section\/unit 1 quizzes and tests. I repeated this for all 4 sections\/units usually just did 1 unit each day until I got to 3 and 4 (still do the quizzes and tests for both 3 and 4 too) since unit 3 really just prioritizes leadership styles and theories so I did that quizlet that is in there that is titled overview of leadership styles and theories and memorized those since they were used in the OA quite a bit, I would try to get familiar with those it will help a lot. There's a few terms you'll still need to use from the unit 3 glossary quizlet so I would still go through it briefly. Unit 4 was mainly common sense so I didn't use that quizlet very much since it wasn't very helpful but I still recommend it, it could still be beneficial for some people. On that same day when I was going over unit 3 and 4 (day before I took the OA), I retook the PA to see where I was after going over unit 3 and 4. I got 3 sections exemplary and the first section I was maybe 2 questions off exemplary.\n\nThe day of the OA I used the crash course quizlet that was in that folder above and used the 348 term quizlet also in the folder to go over any terms that I couldn't remember like Anti-Kickback Laws etc. from past days and any other terms I thought I needed and also used the section 3 glossary for the terms, Theory X and Theory Y. An hour before the OA I reviewed the PA to get familiar again with the way they ask the questions since a vast majority is about applying the knowledge. I ended up passing it and getting all exemplary and it took roughly 50 minutes for me to take. There were also roughly 5 questions that I saw on the OA that were on the PA from my experience. I will also say I did feel there were definitely questions where you pretty much have to pick the rightest right which can be tricky. I hope this guide helps you and feel free to reach out on this thread if this guide helped you or you need help! Good Luck Everyone!

{"post_id":"1jybsj7","subreddit":"WGU","title":"WGU D216 Business Law for Accountants","selftext":"How I passed this class in 5 days (Roughly 25-30 hrs) - \n\nStep 1) Watch all of Elin's videos. While you're watching them, write down any definitions that you are not confident in. Half of the topics in this course are common sense and you don't need to study the things that you can figure out on your own because the material is dense enough as it is. \n\nStep 2) Take the PA. The PA is not a good indicator of if you'll pass the OA anyways as they do not line up. I used this to be able to schedule my OA and to see which areas I was recommended to study. I did not pass my first attempt of the PA and did not retake it because it was basically pointless. \n\nStep 3) Review any of the Units that you are struggling to digest. For me, I was having difficulty with the topics that had a lot of minor things to remember (like specific requirements of special types of contracts i.e. mailbox rule, or the purpose of the specific types of financial acts) \n\nStep 4) Email John Prince and ask him for the difficult exam practice question that he has. Many people had complaints about John, but I can honestly say I would not have passed the OA without his help. He is very blunt, but you should not take that personally. He does not waste time sugar-coating things, he tells you directly why you are right or wrong so that you can actually learn from your mistakes. \n\nStep 5) After reviewing the exam questions from John, use Elin's outline to copy and paste the Units that you still don't understand into Notebook LM. This will create a podcast style explanation of the topic that makes it easier to comprehend. Follow along with the podcast and take notes as if you're learning it again for the first time. \n\nStep 6) Take the OA... I was not confident that I would pass this OA at all, but there was nothing left for me to do to try to better understand the material so I went for it. Thankfully, I passed with this method. \n\n  \nTopics to study for the OA: Securities Exchange Act of 1933, Garnishment, Artisan's and Mechanic's liens, tax and liability implications for different business structures (including liabilities in partnerships specifically), all of the Acts in Unit 8, Bankruptcies 7, 11, 13. \n\n  \nBe prepared when taking this exam, the wording is tricky and it's somewhat hard to decipher what they're even asking for. Good luck with this one, I'd give it a medium difficulty level just because of the denseness of the context and lack of confidence for the OA since the PA is useless.

Took me a week and a half but that's because I procrastinated, I honestly think I could've completed this in 2 days. I read the material, the reading wasn't too bad. I stopped at unit 5 because the course material page crashed (they were doing maintenance on it). I watched all the videos, in 2x speed. I would say unit 4-6 videos were the most helpful. This I did sporadically throughout the week.\n\nThen took PA, passed on the first try with almost all exemplary.\n\nI started studying these below the last two days before the OA, I think took about 8 hours combined in 2 days. :\n\nI found this study guide on Studocu, [https:\/\/www.studocu.com\/en-us\/document\/western-governors-university\/project-management\/project-management-c722-study-guide-docx\/50479879\/download\/project-management-c722-study-guide-docx.pdf](https:\/\/www.studocu.com\/en-us\/document\/western-governors-university\/project-management\/project-management-c722-study-guide-docx\/50479879\/download\/project-management-c722-study-guide-docx.pdf) which was really helpful, it helped me understand the topic better.

(I guessed)\n* There were questions on the phases: Defining, Planning, Executing, and Closing (and control&monitoring) - can't remember the exact wording but it was like, which of the following activity occur during the \\[one of the phases\\]..etc, like #35-37 on the Studocu linked above, i believe there were 2 questions each on each phase\n   * also another question on asking you to number the activities of each phase, similar to the PA question but not exact\n* Define IRR, NPV, Opportunity cost, time value of money, 1 question similar to drop down question on the PA and 2 or 3 on defining these terms\n* Know the Functional and Matrix structure\n* know calendarize budget, couple questions on this\n* There were a lot of questions that asks you to select 2 or 3 answers\n* I also got a couple questions from the PA\n* \\#40 of the practice OA Studocu linked above was on my OA\n* Know checklist, WBS, Gantt\n* There were a lot of scenario based questions\n* Oh and last 2 questions were just feedback questions.\n\nThat's all I can remember from the OA lol but it kind of align with the PA, and definitely aligned with the structure of the course, the questions were in the order of the course material.

The reading material is super hard to get through and the linkedin learning videos that are recommended don't nearly go into enough depth to cover what's needed to pass this exam. I was also constantly fighting with the fact that 12c is EOL and I am likely never going to use the specifics learned here day-to-day. I have zero practical experience with Oracle as well so I knew from the jump that this was probably going to be an uphill climb.\n\nOverall what worked well for me was cramming the following over the course of 5 days (I'm sure if i took any longer I would have started to forget things):\n\n[Oracle 12C Fundamentals Learning Path](https:\/\/app.pluralsight.com\/paths\/skills\/oracle-database-12c-fundamentals) (I watched the first 5 videos twice at 2x and this covered a huge majority of what I saw on the OA.

I just passed this class  on the first try after 7 weeks of studying (not my best pass but a pass is a pass lol) ive only ever seen complaints and fear mongering about this class and I wanted to provide my perspective plus some additional tips. \n\n1. Those who have said they failed this class multiple times are attempting to accelerate (YOU CAN NOT ACCELERATE THIS CLASS UNLESS U HAVE A STRONG BACKGROUND IN ANATOMY)\n\nPassing this class is very possible but you need to study based on the pacing guide, which advised spending 1 week on each section. If you study about 1-2 hours daily for 7-8 weeks you should pass on your first try. Patience is key.\n\n\n2. Use flash cards for the heavier weighted sections (sections 1,3,4,5) I scored unsatisfactory in endocrine systems which is only 6% of the assessment and I still scored competent overall..I wouldn\u2019t focus so much on endocrine and integumentary.\n\n\n3. Use the study guide. The study guide is intended to be filled out by memory but if u ask me that\u2019s impossible to do\u2026\u2026.again unless u have a strong background in anatomy. I used the study guide as an organized method of note taking and a way to lock in information: example: I would watch a video on mitosis and meiosis and immediately afterward I would use that portion of the study guide to explain in my own words the difference of mitosis and meiosis. \n\n4. For more difficult concepts like action potentials and muscle contractions, try to find videos that demonstrate those. It\u2019s easier to remember if u have a visual association.\n\n\n\n5. It\u2019s impossible to fully memorize all the muscles and honestly there wasn\u2019t a whole lot of questions about that on the oa. But what helps is getting familiar with the naming trends and Latin meanings. Example: vastus = great and big. Muscles with this word in the beginning are the big muscles in the leg. \n\n\n\n\nTLDR: if you take your time spend a week on each body systems, get familiar with the muscle naming trends and use the study guide, u should be good \n\n","permalink":"\/r\/WGU\/comments\/1jtrdq1\/d312_anatomy_and_physiology\/","created_utc":1744047917,"score":2,"text_length":2039,"vader_compound":0.9761,"course_code":"D312"}
{"post_id":"1jtu2of","subreddit":"WGU","title":"I passed D333 - Ethics in Technology in 19 days. Here's how I did it.","selftext":"Greetings, Night Owls. I'm writing this guide to discuss the strategies and resources I used to be successful in Ethics in Technology.\n\nFirst of all, email your course instructor or the Ethics in Technology instructor group to ask for the study guide. The study guide is a 31-page document that will help you absorb and understand the textbook material as you read it. Use the study guide, read the relevant portions of the textbook it instructs you to read, and answer the study guide questions as you proceed. Engagement with the textbook is absolutely crucial to pass this class. There's no way out of it.\n\nOnce you've filled out the study guide, you can now begin studying in earnest. The study guide consists of 4 sections which contain study material relevant to the course (Sections 2-5). Study one of those 4 sections in the study guide each day. Furthermore, watch one of these recorded cohorts each day to strengthen your comprehension of the most important subject matter for the Objective Assessment:\n\nEthical Frameworks Cohort: [https:\/\/wgu.hosted.panopto.com\/Panopto\/Pages\/Viewer.aspx?id=1f27ddf8-2c94-46e5-9581-b2260108cd94](https:\/\/wgu.hosted.panopto.com\/Panopto\/Pages\/Viewer.aspx?id=1f27ddf8-2c94-46e5-9581-b2260108cd94)\n\nLaws and Regulations Cohort: [https:\/\/wgu.hosted.panopto.com\/Panopto\/Pages\/Viewer.aspx?id=31efef5b-fd39-4376-844b-b22601088703](https:\/\/wgu.hosted.panopto.com\/Panopto\/Pages\/Viewer.aspx?id=31efef5b-fd39-4376-844b-b22601088703)\n\nAI Ethics and Bias Cohort: [https:\/\/wgu.hosted.panopto.com\/Panopto\/Pages\/Viewer.aspx?id=cfef1c25-d243-4820-bd10-b226010904a1](https:\/\/wgu.hosted.panopto.com\/Panopto\/Pages\/Viewer.aspx?id=cfef1c25-d243-4820-bd10-b226010904a1)\n\n*Note that you need to be logged into your WGU student account in order to access the recorded cohorts.*\n\nAdditionally, email your course instructor or the Ethics in Technology instructor group to ask for the 8 practice quizzes relating to Ethical Frameworks\/Professional Codes, Cybersecurity, Data Privacy, Information Accuracy, Intellectual Property, Information Access, the PAPA model, and the CIA triad respectively. Use these practice quizzes to gauge your understanding of the material. Concentrate on the questions you get wrong and understand why the answer you selected was incorrect.\n\nAfter studying for a week, you should be ready to take the Pre-Assessment. From my experience, the Pre-Assessment was similar to the Objective Assessment but obviously your mileage may vary. If you can pass the Pre-Assessment, you should be ready for the Objective Assessment. If you're feeling brave, then you can take the OA soon after passing the Pre-Assessment. But if you feel like you need a little more time to prepare, there's no shame in that.\n\nUsing these strategies and resources, I was able to pass the OA after being in the class for only 19 days. I could have passed sooner if I wasn't sick and had to take a few days off from studying due to that. The main takeaway here is to not underestimate this class simply because it's a general education class. This class will require steady effort and discipline in order for you to succeed.

I am just months ahead in my program and didn't mind any extra steps before being able to take the OA again. Which honestly can only help me if I didn't pass my initial attempt. \n\nNow my plan was to study if I needed to. But ONLY the material form the course. I was going to use Chat, feed it the pdf files for each chapter, then have it create detailed, but easy to follow notes. This is a good tactic to remove the bloat from chapters I didn't need. However.....\n\nThis exam is MUCH easier then I was made to believe.  I also believe in removing the anonymity aspect of the exam by attempting it so I can a better idea of the format of questions asked. I hate the tragic cycle of overly preparing for an exam THINKING that some sections are more included than others. Which was still true for this exam. For context i studied scripting like NO TOMORROW for the Pentest, and was only asked 3 questions in total about it. Same for all the acronyms. \n\nNext I will say, YOU ALREADY KNOW 80% of the stuff on this OA. If you have made it this far in the course, passed various others certs and exams, you are all ready prepared for this exam. Most of what I encountered I knew. For what I didnt, my context of the things I did KNOW made my guesses a 50\/50 shot every time. And id take those odds any day. \n\nAll and all id say put your faith in YOUR abilities. You made it this far, you belong here, and you got this. You are more skilled than you think. Studying the material matters for sure for the things you don't know. However from my experience the exam consisted of more things that I did. \n\nGood luck out there yall!\n\n\n\n","permalink":"\/r\/WGUCyberSecurity\/comments\/1jo42py\/morning_rant_passed_d487_on_first_attempt_no\/","created_utc":1743430150,"score":17,"text_length":1768,"vader_compound":0.988,"course_code":"D487"}

I'm writing to share my experience with D487 because it was one course that I went at alone. \n\nThe class provides a lot of material to draw from, so those who are completely new to the material would have to take their time and drill down the concepts. It's similar to a CompTIA exam insomuch that one would need to understand the what and the why. If there were a question regarding a certain software dev framework, one would have to be able to recognize the framework, the key positions, and what their job role entails. Don't just stop at learning what STRIDE stands for; understand how it's implemented in SDL. Learn those phases, the deliverables, and the actions that lead to those deliverables. It's really an exercise in discerning \"where does this granular activity fit in the grand scheme?\"\n\nOne pro tip. All of the resources don't agree with each other; for instance, the book maps the SDL to a different version of an SDLC than what the class chooses to follow. So hit the lesson summaries and note the definitions and the 'what you learned' section on the summary page. I would say to learn those items and then work backward through the lesson pages and utilize the resource that mentions it. e.g., The SDLC that we're expected to know is discussed on Pluralsight.\n\nHopefully, all of this makes sense.

In fact it really was my own laziness that made this class remotely frustrating.  I way overthought the class and this kept pushing it back, but if I had just 3 tips for people entering this course it would go as follows:\n\n1.  At the very least skim through the first 2 chapters a few times to refresh yourself on the terms and different queries.   This will help with the following steps.\n\n2.  The bulk of the exam is actually preforming SQL queries, so do every single practice prompt and lab in those first 2 chapters.  \n\n3.  The test and practice exam are very similar.  In each you will have a run code option under your problem.  This can help you to verify that you haven\u2019t made any critical errors in your syntax.\n\nBONUS:  CHATGPT is actually pretty good at writing the level of SQL required in this test.  I personally tried my best on the practice problems that didn\u2019t completely stump me and input the question into CHATGPT to compare and see where I may need to review specifically.  You should be able to run every query on the practice exam without assistance before trying your hand at the real deal (obviously).\n\nDon\u2019t overthink it.

The practice questions are cool too.\n   * Also, Josh Madakor created 1000 practice questions based around the Sybex book. I didn't use these so I can't attest to how good they are, but they're probably worth looking into. \n   * [https:\/\/joshmadakor.tech\/cysa\/](https:\/\/joshmadakor.tech\/cysa\/)\n* Cybervista: This contains roughly 250 questions and you can customize your practice test based on the particular objectives you want to review.\n* Google: For things that I didn't feel I was getting enough info on from the reading, primarily NMAP.\n\nThese were pretty much all of my resources for the exam.

{"post_id":"1hgktaw","subreddit":"WGUCyberSecurity","title":"Passed D485!","selftext":"This was one of the harder PAs, I think, but I had task 2 so it was only a paper and not a recording. The lab environment is a bit of a mess and I didn't utilize my time the best the first few times I logged in, so I ended up having to redo a few bits of work multiple times so I could show the end results of *other* changes in screenshots. An example is moving a resource, then changing something about that resource and showing it done in a screenshot. If it isn't moved correctly, then the RG would be wrong in the screenshot, etc.\n\nLike other people have said, if something doesn't work in the lab, just explain how you would complete the task if it was working, etc. and you'll be fine. I wasn't 100% happy with how it looked or how I handled those problems, but I submitted it anyway and got a first-time pass, so I think once you get it to like 70% or 80% in your head, give it a shot. My paper ended up at 31 pages with the title page, table of contents, tons of screenshots, and works cited included, but there was a lot less writing in this one than others I've done so far.\n\nIf I had to do it again, I would build a better skeleton of the report and basically pre-write the different tasks I was going to do before doing them; that way, I could just go back and add screenshots after everything was organized and at least theoretically done. I did the paper over probably 10 hours in a bunch of different sessions, so managing tons of screenshots and making sure they were for the right task was a little rough but it turned out fine.","permalink":"\/r\/WGUCyberSecurity\/comments\/1hgktaw\/passed_d485\/","created_utc":1734469569,"score":16,"text_length":1574,"vader_compound":0.8336,"course_code":"D485"}

{"post_id":"1hfvoi7","subreddit":"WGUCyberSecurity","title":"DON'T SLEEP ON PRERECORDED COHORTS!! MSCIA Program","selftext":"Seriously, this is something I really wish was emphasized--I probably would have been graduating by now instead of overstressing, so I will pass the information along. Prerecorded cohorts essentially tells you the blueprint of how to construct your assignments and what the instructors are looking for. For a lot of these courses, it is sooooo easy to overthink the assignments (ahem D482).  Dare I say, 90-95% of your confusion and questions for these assignments would be resolved by watching the cohorts. \n  \nFor the PAs, I know most people says to \"write to the rubric\" but even that can be seen as a bit vague of an advice, especially if the rubric isn't that clear, does not really align with the actual questions being asked-- or you haven't done enough paper assignments with WGU to grasp what the evaluators are seeking. \n\nYou can find those cohorts usually under the announcements\/course tips section or if the instructor uploads a course syllabus. I emphasize \"prerecorded\" sessions because not everyone is able to attend the live sessions, and you can refer to the video for each task at your own pace. Ask your instructor if there's one available too. \n\nYou'll find that some of these papers people were writing 20, 30, 40 pages for-- you might do it in less than 15 (really, less than 10 in some cases lol) and still pass! So far, I have completed two PAs and I haven\u2019t written more than 6 or 7 pages per PA. Granted, everyone has a different writing style and will understand the tasks differently so don\u2019t feel like you are writing too much or too little. As everyone says, just write what is being asked\u2014 as long as you can focus on the competency requirements, you should be fine. Again, the cohorts will provide exactly how to go about the assignment\u2014 that\u2019s already about 70% of your work and stress alleviation right there. The rest is your research, knowledge, understanding and how you construct your papers. \n\nAlso, depending on the course assignment, you can supplement writing a traditional paper and do a constructed PowerPoint presentation in lieu of. (I\u2019ve seen some people mention they did it for the D482 course).\n\nGive yourself grace if you are going a bit slower than your peers, it's okay if you didn't finish in \"six months\" or less. It's okay if you find courses challenging, where others found it \"easy\" to get through in a day. Don't be intimidated, by other people's progress. Your journey is yours alone. It's a \"marathon, not a race\" as cliche as it sounds. The aim and goal is to \\*pass\\*, not be an overachiever --unless that's naturally who you are, then that's okay too :)... As far as I am concerned, a win is a win-- We all going to eventually get the same degree one way or another lol","permalink":"\/r\/WGUCyberSecurity\/comments\/1hfvoi7\/dont_sleep_on_prerecorded_cohorts_mscia_program\/","created_utc":1734388600,"score":60,"text_length":2789,"vader_compound":0.9916,"course_code":"D482"}

D488 builds upon those exams but does not go very deep into the subject matter.   From ISC2 to ISACA to CompTIA to WGU, you will note that tests from each vendor have a distinct writing style or voice.  The writing style of the questions on the OA was consistent with that of the PA.  I used any knowledge gaps noted in the pre-assessment to determine where to spend my study time in preparation for the OA.  I listened to a few cryptography lessons on Jason Dion's CASP+ course and spent some time reviewing the CertMaster questions to ensure I understood the concepts.  Risk management was the flavor of the day for my test.\n\nI'm glad to be finished with the two WGU OAs.  The tests were not difficult.

{"post_id":"1gm8dor","subreddit":"WGUCyberSecurity","title":"PASSED! D335- INTRO TO PYTHON","selftext":"I wanted to post about my experience with D335 as my experience was a lot different than a lot of posts.  I tried to go the path of just learning ch. 34 and the PA. It was a complete disaster for me. For some background. Prior to this class I had only taken the programming fundamentals class. It was just pseudocode, no actual programming.  I also have never learned any other programming languages.  I was a total newbie to programming.  It is embarrassing to admit, but I had to take this class over three different terms. That amount of time was hard to swallow. I want others to know that it doesn't matter how long it takes. What matters is never giving up. Tonight I passed the python OA and did really good on it. I am definitely celebrating. \n\n Here is what finally worked for me. I tried a lot of different methods and resources.  Hopefully someone can find something useful in this post. \n\nI would highly recommend Angela Yu's 100 days of code on Udemy. I did up to day 17. She does a really good job at explaining concepts in a way that made sense to me. I went through most of the ZyBooks labs and still was not getting it. I decided to break down exactly what I wasn't understanding.  There were two big things that I needed to study independently. The first was how to effectively problem solve. That is what your doing with code,  just problem solving.  I watch a lot of YouTube videos on how to effectively problem solve while coding.  The second thing I needed to learn was some basic math. The instructions says you don't need to, but I definitely did. I also used YouTube videos to learn basic math and I also looked up basic math for coding.  The next thing that I had to do was to break it down into a bunch of pieces. Not everyone needs to do this, but it helped me understand the concepts so much better.  I thought of it like I had a big toy box filled with blocks. Each block is a concept of coding, like a for loop, a while loop, strings, lists,  etc.... I picked up one block at a time and learned as much as I could about that block, once I was confident in that block I moved to the next block. After going through each block I put them into piles. All the blocks in a particular pile all fit together and I spent time figuring how each block could interact with other blocks. Once I felt comfortable with all the blocks I moved back to ZyBooks. \n\nI know everyone hates ZyBooks, and I do to, but I felt that ZyBooks was crucial to me passing the OA. This is the resources that I stress as the most important. The OA is graded the same as ZyBooks so it is important to understand how they do it. This is where I learned the most. I sat in front of my computer for an unreal amount of time just coding all the labs. If you're struggling to get this class you need hands on the keyboard and lots of coding exercises.  I did every chapter and lab, except for the optional ones. I did all the labs multiple times. Once I got them down, I would copy the word problem into chatGPT and ask it to give me a problem that uses the same coding concepts, but to ask me to output different result. I also was very specific that chatGPT NOT give me any code, only the written word problem. Once I was comfortable with the concepts that is when I started focusing on ch. 34 and the PA. The OA is similar, but different enough that you do have to know how to put code together to get the desired output. \n\nThis approach most definitely won't be for everyone, but it might help someone who is struggling.  I had to do it the long and hard way, but perseverance pays off. \n\nMy last little bit of advice is to never compare yourself to others. Everyone is on their own path and have their own level of knowledge.  Just get up everyday and put one foot in front of the other. Slow progress is still progress. If you're struggling with python just keep at it. You'll get there.\n","permalink":"\/r\/WGUCyberSecurity\/comments\/1gm8dor\/passed_d335_intro_to_python\/","created_utc":1731033772,"score":26,"text_length":3906,"vader_compound":0.9454,"course_code":"D335"}

First time doing any college, my initial term I completed 13 credits and 17 on the next. I have partial (basically no) IT experience from being a prior Airborne Radar Technician for the Air Force. Personally it was a bit of a challenge balancing working full time, commitments and relationships. Looking back, I definitely could've done more in my first term but I ended up taking it slower and tried not to get too overwhelmed.\n\nHonestly I couldn't tell you why this class was so much of a struggle for me, I originally planned for this course to be done in two weeks. A main factor was I really wasn't in the best headspace with other factors weighing on my mind. I went through a couple Reddit posts about this class and I feel like they're a bit outdated, but it is true there is a good amount of overlap from previous classes. Section one and two are pretty straightforward. For me the main things I focused on memorizing\/understanding to improve my results were router types, what processes operate a which OSI + TCP\/IP layer, principles of network security(Fail-safe, economy of a mechanism, least common mechanism etc.) and various quizzlets that I found. After talking with the instructors they basically said that section 3 is rarely ever passed on the OA, so expect to get most of your points from the first two. They also have some extra pre-tests that'll help gauge where your at. I really overthought a lot of questions as well the way they worded some of them really will throw you off if you don't fully understand a concept or read it too quickly.\n\nBreaking it down into specific topics helped me a lot instead of the broad info in each section. Hopefully this helps someone out just wanted to dump this while it was still fresh. I'll can try n help with whatever questions. I'm about to be on a term break while I wait for more MilTA so I can start my next term, thankfully. I was on the verge of a burn out if I failed this test again with three days in my term lol.\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/ycwwktuw6kld1.jpg?width=1284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0898150cb5ed7c9cf227fe89502fd17d34f4fccf\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/t7ps90vw6kld1.jpg?width=1284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f875396b56d0e5c6a97a7f2f1ed1d345bf60c954\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/1oi3etuw6kld1.jpg?width=1284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ae19fbe70c7d9047098530d6bbdab50468008b5a\n\n","permalink":"\/r\/WGUCyberSecurity\/comments\/1f3wpha\/third_times_a_charm_d315_network_and_security\/","created_utc":1724917462,"score":8,"text_length":2099,"vader_compound":0.9924,"course_code":"D315"}

{"post_id":"1i3gsxq","subreddit":"WGUIT","title":"I Passed the D522 Course! \ud83c\udf89","selftext":"# My Thoughts on the Course\n\n1. **ZyBooks as a Resource** I found the ZyBooks platform to be a fairly good resource. However, I think it could benefit from being more comprehensive, especially with additional coding practice. WGU should also consider including topics like working with XML, JSON, YAML, and modules such as `netmiko` and `socket`. While it might be challenging to integrate these into the ZyBooks platform, finding a way to encourage active coding is essential. Coding is truly something you learn by doing.\n2. **Differences Between the OA and PA** The Objective Assessment (OA) and the Performance Assessment (PA) aren\u2019t as similar as I expected. While the general layout is the same\u2014coding and multiple-choice questions\u2014I only recognized two questions on the OA from the PA (one coding and one multiple choice). Here are my key tips for preparing:\n   * Be comfortable taking numbers from a list and joining them as a string.\n   * Know how to work with time-related functions.\n   * Understand how to handle XML.\n   * Keep your approach simple. Some of the coding questions felt intimidating at first, but they often required just a couple of minor tweaks, such as changing an operator or making a small edit to the logic.\n3. **Additional Resources** Take advantage of Udemy, you have access to it. I highly recommend the *100 Days of Code* course, which is excellent for hands-on practice. Unfortunately, I discovered this course only a week before my test, so I didn\u2019t get to use it as much as I would have liked.\n4. **Help()** On some of the code questions they will already have the help() populated with a function that would help on that question. Make sure you play around with using help and understand how and when to use it. Just put a # in front of all the other lines and uncomment help() and run it with the function you think you might need. This saved me on at least 3 of the questions. \n\n# Final Thoughts\n\nIf you\u2019re preparing for this course, focus on practicing coding as much as possible and don\u2019t get discouraged by the difficulty level. Stay focused, keep your solutions simple, and you\u2019ll do great!\n\nGood luck to everyone currently working on this course\u2014you\u2019ve got this! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/2q1ihq7i7kde1.png?width=1061&format=png&auto=webp&s=d9b00e825bd76519c477bbf7cf1782e0757fdcee","permalink":"\/r\/WGUIT\/comments\/1i3gsxq\/i_passed_the_d522_course\/","created_utc":1737121954,"score":8,"text_length":2238,"vader_compound":0.9964,"course_code":"D522"}

I actually used the CertMaster Learn material, but in PDF form along with using Professor Messer video series for review. The reason I used the CertMaster material was due to taking the A+ exam and noted the terms and language used in the exam was similar to what they used in CertMaster versus outside material (kinda obvious, same company). I wanted to be familiar with the exam language and used the official study material as my main source. \n\nI skim through the PBQ's, practice exams, and the labs for each chapter due to not having the time to go through everything. The CertMaster material is very dense with information and I was following the 2 month pacing guide. \n\n  \nFor reviewing and getting prepared for the exam, I used the CertMaster Practice and each review I would go over each question and look up any concepts I was not familiar with in the CertMaster material. It took me a total of 6 attempts before I received the minimum score to take the exam. \n\nFor the actual exam, like others have mentioned, I skipped the PBQs and just focused on the multiple choice questions. I had left over time and reviewed all the multiple choice questions then submitted my exam.\n\nIf I was able to have the luxury of time, I would have taken another 2 months to study before taking the exam. However, I couldn't pass the course with 2 months left in my previous term. When I started my new term, I just wanted to pass the course and move on with my other classes, but review the material again at my own pace when I passed the exam. Also had the deadline of 12\/20 to pass the version I was studying (N10-008) before WGU moved onto the newer version (N10-009).\n\nThose of you who are taking this course, study wisely and have luck!

My first term I did well then the steam roller got slower and slower and with quite a bit of other things going on in my life chugged to nearly a halt. After several terms of very little progress I was finally looking toward the end. As of about 2 weeks ago I had to finish up my Capstone and had one lingering class left. C777.\n\nGot my capstone in and was left with C777. I only had about 8 days of study before my term ended. Last day of my term was Sep30th. So I crammed and crammed the last week and several days ago scheduled my OA at 11:40pm Sept 30th. I know I was cutting it close but wanted time to study all day and then take the exam.\n\nAt 11:40pm on the dot after the timer ran down I was given access to take the test button. I pressed it and.....GOT an ERROR!!! The button disappeared and was unable to get into the Queue for the exam. I started to panic and IMMEDIATELY opened up a text chat. Long story short I had to wait roughly an hour before they could get me into the exam.\n\nSo even though I had my test scheduled to start before the term ended at 11:40pm eastern time It didn't actually start till closer to 1am Oct1st. Worst part about it with the end of the month and term switch over I no longer have access to the course or degree page and have no way to even see if I passed the OA or not!!!\n\nI'm on pins and needles and can't sleep not knowing if I passed the last class or failed, and I am concerned if since my test didn't actually start though no fault of my own at 1am OCT 1st if my transcripts will show an incomplete and I will be rolled into a new term or if they will correct the issue.\n\nNot sure what to do at this point, I'm wired right now not knowing if I'm finished FINALLY and who I'm going to have to get ahold of to see how it all affects my terms. I've emailed my mentor and assessment services but it will be hours and hours before I hear anything back at all.

The next morning I went over the Jason Dion cram cards for a half hour before my exam.\n\nThat's all. I took the exam and got a 32\/40 with probably \\~3 hours of studying total.

At first I thought okay cool because now I can save the Capstone for the masters portion but then I realized It's weird because that defeats the purpose of it being accelerated, considering I've already done two of the master classes.  In his defense, he said shouldn't have enabled the 900 series courses for me , he just wasnt paying attention.\n\nSo my question is has anyone else faced this issue or is my mentor misinformed?

I would then start the next semester with 6 classes left in the master's portion , and a separate capstone for that as well .

(scoring in the mid 70s then mock 6 I got an 80).\n   3. Studied the Jason Dion 5 page Cram Card. \\*\\*\\* Please at least review this a couple times before the exam (an extra hour before exam is what i did).\n3. **Watched This mock exam video**  \n\n   1. Youtube: [https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=SuSC7qHbaqE&t=810s](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=SuSC7qHbaqE&t=810s)\n   2. This video had a couple questions that were REALLY close to the exam questions.\n4. **Study Guide**  \n\n   1. Read over the study guide that is provided in the course chatter.\n5. **Quizlet** (not necessary)  \n\n   1. There are a few quizlets that were helpful for memory of terms. One breaks down each deck into the different sections (focus on practices as that is where a lot of the questions come from 17-19). I didn't spend much time using quizlet.\n\nTHAT'S IT!\n\n**Conclusion:** The exam IMO was super straightforward and easy. It did not try to trick me or confuse me with the way the questions were worded. Which was very refreshing, considering most of the OA's I've taken so far through WGU, have all been like some sort of sick mind game. ***I think I scored so high because I over studied. So if you are limited on time the value insights videos\/mock exams along with the Dion mock exams will get you pretty far imo.***\n\n**Final Tips: Don't just memorize stuff, have a general understanding and how they apply. This course can be knocked out in a 3-5 dedicated days pretty easy.**\n\n**Good Luck!**","permalink":"\/r\/WGUIT\/comments\/1cgurqt\/business_of_it_applications_d336_passed_in_3_days\/","created_utc":1714488702,"score":25,"text_length":1734,"vader_compound":0.965,"course_code":"D336"}

{"post_id":"1asrrg0","subreddit":"WGUIT","title":"D315 - Network and Security Foundations","selftext":"For what it\u2019s worth, my advice is that if you passed the PA first attempt with flying colors, go ahead and take the OA, then, if you fail, study those areas, then take it. A lot of the questions were common sense to me as someone who has been in IT for an appreciable amount of time (< 10 years). Definitely learn the OSI model, and networking commands on Windows\/Linux. Learn different network topologies, and the different cybersecurity concepts.\n\nDisclaimer: I never used the course material. I have experience in IT, but never studied networking at previous universities. Based on my experience I felt ready, though I\u2019ve never had a networking specific job, or one focused on cybersecurity. I\u2019ve done development and administration recently as far as career is concerned.\n\nRealizations: Yes, the OA is different than the PA, but to me it was easier in some aspects. I got competent\/exemplary in all categories. If you\u2019ve never done this for a career, I see how it might be difficult, but if you\u2019re in IT, it\u2019s very easy to pass. The questions aren\u2019t worded in a way to trick you, often times, there is one obvious correct answer.\n\nTips: There is a study guide floating around that highlights areas that you should focus on. Use that. It\u2019s not just giving answers for incompetent individuals, but gives a good overall sense of the types of things that you should focus on. You need to learn this stuff anyway to be successful in day-to-day IT, so for your sake, just learn it.\n\nSummary: I spent way too much time preparing for this OA when I most likely could have passed it day one given my previous experience.","permalink":"\/r\/WGUIT\/comments\/1asrrg0\/d315_network_and_security_foundations\/","created_utc":1708139345,"score":5,"text_length":1668,"vader_compound":0.9625,"course_code":"D315"}

I shockingly found the OA slightly easier than the PA, but don't take my word for it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI already use HTML (only) at my job, so HTML I am familiar with. I am not familiar with CSS\/JS. But I found that so long as you take the time to learn all the syntax, at that point its mostly logic based.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI took the PA, scored a 50% first try. I DID NOT LOOK AT THE ANSWERS, that would've been setting myself up for failure. 3 weeks later after using the entire left side of the study guide, some quizzes here and there, and Quizlet in learn mode, I scored a 70% on the PA and passed. The only field I still did bad on was Javascript. For the next 7-9 days I studied extra hard on CSS and JS before taking the OA.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEverything I did and recommend:\n\nUSE THE STUDY GUIDE. \n\nhttps:\/\/srm--c.vf.force.com\/apex\/coursearticle?Id=kA03x000000l9D8CAI\n\nIt will tell you everything you need to know. Use the 21 Days pacing guide within the study guide to give you some guidance and pacing but I personally did not use it.\n\nLeft side of study guide: where you actually learn the material from. Important to note that while w3schools will have a lot more tags and content to cover than the study guide, just know that you do NOT need to read EVERY SINGLE HTML\/CSS\/JS related item from w3school. Made that mistake with the HTML portion and I'm glad I found out what I really needed to do before I wasted anymore time doing this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou're also recommended to use Acrobatiq. You will only find that material if you go to the class in your student portal and click \"Go To Course Material\". I do NOT recommend using it, and I didn't personally didn't use it. It\u2019s a huge waste of time and it greatly annoyed me as I'm hopping between a gazillion different links. Just use w3schools, or the content on the left side of the study guide. If necessary and you're not clicking with the material from w3schools, then by all means: use Acrobatiq. Be prepared to spend extra time though.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMiddle side of study guide: Be sure that you can answer the study questions in the middle. If you can't, you can use this: [https:\/\/docs.google.com\/document\/d\/e\/2PACX-1vR2jMuLRoNvnks672ZIcQqmmOEj-Gbda3suhShCiWW4behAjYXeupcxTHkVNIJ-IMM8wvygPUU80GyS\/pub](https:\/\/docs.google.com\/document\/d\/e\/2PACX-1vR2jMuLRoNvnks672ZIcQqmmOEj-Gbda3suhShCiWW4behAjYXeupcxTHkVNIJ-IMM8wvygPUU80GyS\/pub) to brush up on the questions. Me personally, I was able to answer most of these questions but the ones I couldn't, I just used the link. Near the end questions aren't answered, but that's ok because the most important units are covered. API, Forms, and Mobile sections are dead easy anyways.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRight side of study guide: This contains the Cohorts, LinkedIn Learning videos, QuizZETS, QuizLETS, SoloLearn, and practices from w3schools. I personally only used the QuizLETS and put it in learn mode. I wouldn't bother with the quizzets, they have a lot of questions that just aren't on the exam. Good for overall context, not good if you just want to learn what you need to know on the exam. The linkedin learning quizzes are decent. The w3school exercises are pretty great. I didn\u2019t watch any videos or Cohorts though I heard good things about them. Again, if you're struggling then by all means: use EVERYTHING they throw at you. I personally didn't as it would've taken way more time and I had 7 weeks left on my term anyways.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso use these quizzes, they go hard on CSS and Javascript.\n\n[https:\/\/forms.office.com\/Pages\/ResponsePage.aspx?id=z5Knz2h3QUOIV4F1TCr6Hxrw56jBbltMm2Nm1QehDdBUNThNMzBURUEyWTY4UVpWSlRGMk9QT1dBNyQlQCN0PWcu](https:\/\/forms.office.com\/Pages\/ResponsePage.aspx?id=z5Knz2h3QUOIV4F1TCr6Hxrw56jBbltMm2Nm1QehDdBUNThNMzBURUEyWTY4UVpWSlRGMk9QT1dBNyQlQCN0PWcu)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https:\/\/forms.office.com\/Pages\/ResponsePage.aspx?id=z5Knz2h3QUOIV4F1TCr6Hxrw56jBbltMm2Nm1QehDdBUNVpWNkdVSEZJNk1FNk9VSDdQODBBNEE4VSQlQCN0PWcu](https:\/\/forms.office.com\/Pages\/ResponsePage.aspx?id=z5Knz2h3QUOIV4F1TCr6Hxrw56jBbltMm2Nm1QehDdBUNVpWNkdVSEZJNk1FNk9VSDdQODBBNEE4VSQlQCN0PWcu)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI may be the first person ever on any WGU channel to recommend this but: ChatGPT is surprisingly good here, but ONLY GPT 4.0. Do NOT, I repeat, do NOT use GPT 3.5. I have tested 10 questions from one source (don't remember) and ran it into GPT 3.5. GPT 3.5 got 7\/10 questions right, which seemed\u2026 odd. Its possible that the official source is wrong, but I'm sure its unlikely the official source is wrong. So I ran it with GPT 4.0, and it got all 10\/10 question right as well as super detailed explanations of why not only said answer is right, but why the other questions were wrong. THIS IS HUGE! Most of the quiz sources I used will only tell me if I got something right or wrong, but doesn't explain ALL the choices. GPT 4.0 actually does. By explaining why that answer is right, and why the rest is wrong, I have a better understanding of the material in question.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI highly recommend GPT 4.0. The downside to this is that GPT 4.0 will cost you $20 USD per month. Considering the average user will need to spend 1 month on this course, that is plenty. To ensure you do not go over the 1 month period and pay again when you're done with the course, I would only pay for GPT 4.0 ONLY AFTER you have read all the material and you start taking quizzes and practice exams because I think so long as you're focused, you really should only spend 1-3 weeks on quizzes and brushing up on things you're still under competent on.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDay of the exam: I woke up at 8am, I used ALL the quizlets one more time in Learn mode, used the study guide note, and reviewed my latest PA attempt one final time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat's all. This was my last class and I'm glad to be over it. Will get my graduation stuff done soon. Good luck.","permalink":"\/r\/WGUIT\/comments\/1aonubh\/not_only_did_i_pass_c777_web_development\/","created_utc":1707700165,"score":39,"text_length":5154,"vader_compound":0.988,"course_code":"C777"}

Since then a death in the family pushed studying back. I went thru everything on WGU, which was a ton of videos. So I took notes and reviewed. Then I took the 100 question \"practice test\", except as I started taking it, I realized I had no clue if I was getting anything correct or not. Went online to find practice questions, but most were the previous test version. I've gotten conflicting info on what's actually different, so I don't know what to look for.

I figure I'll start somewhere else. So I look at course chatter and it's recommended to go to Udemy and through Stephan's videos.

Here is my experience and recommendation.\n\nFirst off I don't have any IT job experience at all, but I have passed ITIL, Linux essentials, A+, Net+, and Sec+ recently. So those classes first and foremost cover 90% of what the SSCP covers. I do also have manager experience from being an E5 in the AF. \n\nThe SSCP covers just a bit more than Sec+ but less deep. For example you may need to learn the encryptions and memorize a bunch of them but you rarely need to know the actual key sizes. \n\nI had planned for two weeks to study for this and then I would have to drive 2 hours to take the test in a test center (they don't allow online testing). Unfortunately I got incredibly ill and went to the ER with some type of sickness for 1 week that took me away from the studies. \n\nOn the second week I felt almost myself so I watched Mike Chapples LinkedIn learning course on 2x speed. This covers about 80% of what you need to know. \nWe get this for free in wgu.\n\nNext I'd recommend doing Mike Chapples practice test book which is also included in WGU. These questions really felt similar in difficulty to the test. It really prepares you to think like how the test wants you to think. We also get this free in wgu.\n\nI went through each domain and then did one practice test. I didn't grade it. I just went through until I was comfortable. \n\nBoth of these resources are provided to you in a welcome email to the course from your CI. Otherwise Google it. \n\nI also went through and made a Quizlet folder filled with handy dandy sets. Everything in that folder will help you. It should include some of my various sets AND the official ISC2 sscp Quizlets. The isc2 Quizlets can also be found on their website. Just lmk if you want the link and I'll give it to you, I just know reddit doesn't like Quizlet links. \n\nI went through my quizlets a bit, then read through the practice tests the weekend before. \n\nLastly on the monday of the test I barely studied at all since I had to drive so long to the test center. I did go over my SSCP FULL SET in my Quizlet before I walked in to refresh myself on my encryption brain thingies and get the info fresh. \n\nAs for the test you get 4 hours, and it's 150 questions. When I passed I didn't get my score. It just said congrats you passed. I can't discuss what the questions actually said but I can abstract a few things for you. \n\nIn comparison to sec+ where the questions try to trip you up, these will not, instead the SSCP is meant to make you think as a manager and decide what may be best, least, or most amazing in a situation. You'll have to think of it coming from a manager perspective. \n\nI personally enjoyed this challenging test, I felt that it was difficult but only in that I had to know so many topics. \n\nWhen I went through this course I barely had any recent posts I had seen talking about their experience with this test so I wanted to contribute. Hope this helps someone \u2764\ufe0f\n\nTLDR; It's sec+ with another 20% in length in terms of topics, test doesn't trip you up like CompTIA, use Mike Chapples LinkedIn video series and practice test, feel free to ask for my Quizlets.","permalink":"\/r\/WGUIT\/comments\/19dgm6n\/sscp_c845_passed\/","created_utc":1705986209,"score":7,"text_length":3152,"vader_compound":0.9955,"course_code":"C845"}

My main question for this post is this; am I ready to take and pass the OA?\n\nI do understand that even the instructors state that simply passing the Pre-A isn't a good indicator for whether you are going to pass (why is that even the case, I feel like it shouldn't be, what even is the point of the Pre-A in this case?), but there really isn't anything else to actually gauge if you are going to pass. Sure you could take their Quizzets and Quizlets but all that really does IMO is either force you to memorize answers or test your recall of certain topics, the latter of which I feel like I have already done.\n\nI stuck entirely to the study guide, going through ALL of the W3 pages linked and I feel pretty good. I wouldn't be able to write much code but I understand *basic* structure, syntax, and can recall most of the information W3 states for each topic. For example, when I see \"Emulators\" I immediately think cross-browser compatibility, which was literally the base for one of the questions on the Pre-A.\n\nObviously, it looks like I am pretty good with APIs, Forms, & Mobile Devices, and mostly good with HTML\/CSS. JS was the only one I didn't score *competent* on, and I think a large part of that is because I saw a couple code-interpretation things that weren't on the topics from study guide and drew blanks.\n\nWhat I am trying to do is (1), avoid failing and retaking the exam and being forced to get 100% on literally everything and pouring hours I would consider to be *mostly* wasted reaching the 100% bar for the instructors, and (2), avoid touching any more Quizzets\/Quizlets and passing the exam ASAP.\n\nWould anybody be willing to put their 2c in here? What was your Pre-A score and did you pass? Should I be good to go based on where I currently am?\n\nEdit: for some reason my screenshot of my Scoring Report didn't upload with this: [Scoring Report](https:\/\/gyazo.com\/96378e448e26297ace6041151c4eb497).\n\nEdit2: I have decided to x-post this post to this sub for more visibility\/potential feedback.","permalink":"\/r\/WGUIT\/comments\/196mzd0\/c777_prea_passed_am_i_ready_for_the_oa_web\/","created_utc":1705258154,"score":3,"text_length":2269,"vader_compound":0.9718,"course_code":"C777"}

I recommend taking the PA first and studying the course compentancies where you score below competent. Your CI should email you some practice tests and additional course instruction videos (recommend both of these). Find a quizlet and keep using it until you feel you understand the terms.

The next day, I began the CBT Nuggets Project+ course with the free 7-day trial. I watched all these videos on 1.6x speed, and did not take notes.\n\nOnce through all the videos, I started jamming out the Dion practice tests through Udemy. Around this same time, I got the \"IT & Cybersecurity Pocket Prep\" app from the Apple App store. I did a 1 month subscription to this app for $20, as I was struggling to find additional resources for the PK0-005 outside of Dion and CBT Nuggets. This app provided 500 practice questions, which I worked through during the next few days, essentially whenever I had free time.\n\nThe app has a \"quick 10\" quiz feature which I thought was nice, it let me fit in little study breaks whenever there was a break in my schedule.\n\nI continued this regimen through the work week this week, and this morning before work took the PK0-005 test at a testing center near my workplace. This morning I also finished the last practice test in Dion's set, scoring a 93%.\n\nI had 1 PBQ on the test, and 80 multiple choice questions. Overall, it was not too difficult in my opinion.

Each sentence was laden with corporate buzzwords, strung together in what felt like a tangled web of confusion. The actual information hidden within this linguistic chaos was akin to buried treasure in a minefield.\n\nI embarked on this treacherous journey armed with determination and a dogged will to conquer this bureaucratic beast. But the path was riddled with frustration. The sheer volume of impenetrable terminology threatened to sink my spirits. It was a war of attrition against words that seemed to speak a language of their own, a coded dialect reserved for the initiated few.\n\nAnd then came the day of reckoning, the exam itself. A Kafkaesque ordeal awaited me in the form of proctoring requirements that defied the laws of physics. The proctors, guardians of the digital realm, demanded the impossible. **They wanted eyes on my front door and hallway simultaneously, a logistical riddle wrapped in absurdity.**\n\nI found myself embroiled in a surreal battle with the proctors, defending the impossibility of complying with their outrageous demands. How does one keep an eye on two different spaces separated by walls? The laws of physics scoffed at this request, yet the proctors seemed steadfast in their folly.\n\nIt was a chaotic scene, a clash between the bureaucratic whimsy of the digital overseers and the practical realities of existence. They threatened to cancel my test, hanging the sword of Damocles over my head for failing to achieve the unachievable.\n\nIn the end, amidst this whirlwind of nonsensical obstacles, I emerged victorious. I navigated the maze of words, survived the absurdity of proctoring, and emerged on the other side with the coveted ITIL v4 certification in hand. But the scars of this gonzo adventure remain\u2014a testament to the surreal circus that was my journey through the world of ITIL v4\n\n&#x200B;\n\nstudy materials i cant emphasize enough: CyberVista practice exam & ITIL v4 Foundation value insights channel on youtube. the cybervista was really close to the real thing.

Take the PA.  I failed straight out the gate, but it helped me find out my weaker areas (which were many)\n\nStep 2.)  Fill out the study guide that's in the supplementary resources page under Course Tips from the Course view in WGU.  This actually took me a while, but I did it while at work so it didn't feel like it took that long.  Does that make me a cyberloafer?  LOL\n\nStep 3.)  Read through the whole in website course material (not necessarily the book, but it doesn't hurt to skim some of the book too)\n\nStep 4.)  Just do all the course material practice questions until you have all of them done.  While I did this, I took notes for each question I got wrong.  Ended up with about 12 pages of notes.  This was good.  Now I was ready for more study.\n\nStep 5.)  WATCH THIS AI BIAS VIDEO on Pluralsight and take some notes on it!!! (your WGU student status gets you a free pluralsight membership btw in case you didn't know now you know)\n\n[https:\/\/app.pluralsight.com\/course-player?courseId=f56882b8-f5d9-4a5a-97a4-cea844249ac2](https:\/\/app.pluralsight.com\/course-player?courseId=f56882b8-f5d9-4a5a-97a4-cea844249ac2)\n\nStep 6.)  Quizlet!  I don't usually use quizlet, but I found it to be really useful for this course. Specifically use the multiple choice study mode on these four quizlets until you get 90-100% on each one:\n\nSection 2 - [https:\/\/quizlet.com\/853126787\/test?funnelUUID=34618dea-f98e-4772-86f1-12d0c2d48401](https:\/\/quizlet.com\/853126787\/test?funnelUUID=34618dea-f98e-4772-86f1-12d0c2d48401)\n\nSection 3 - [https:\/\/quizlet.com\/853176129\/test?funnelUUID=d66bc63f-5dc7-4818-a192-b04200ed6e54](https:\/\/quizlet.com\/853176129\/test?funnelUUID=d66bc63f-5dc7-4818-a192-b04200ed6e54)\n\nSection 4 - [https:\/\/quizlet.com\/853183199\/test?funnelUUID=1b7113de-d616-4237-86a6-1987d5d3d432](https:\/\/quizlet.com\/853183199\/test?funnelUUID=1b7113de-d616-4237-86a6-1987d5d3d432)\n\nSection 5 - [https:\/\/quizlet.com\/853194863\/test?funnelUUID=d87c49c1-a2a4-49c7-8570-8d7c289a3594](https:\/\/quizlet.com\/853194863\/test?funnelUUID=d87c49c1-a2a4-49c7-8570-8d7c289a3594)\n\nIt's important that whatever questions you get wrong here, you take some notes on them to reinforce WHY you got them wrong rather than just memorizing the answer.  At least, that's what works for me.\n\nStep 7.)  MOAR QUIZLET!!!!!!\n\nOnce you have those practice questions down pat I'd guess you're probably pretty much ready to take the exam as long as you took notes on what you got wrong and understand WHY the answers are what they are.  As a final review, go to this quizlet and do maybe 60 multiple choice questions on it:\n\n[https:\/\/quizlet.com\/744498577\/test?funnelUUID=d7c8768a-5f81-40d7-9f40-ac6957509ceb](https:\/\/quizlet.com\/744498577\/test?funnelUUID=d7c8768a-5f81-40d7-9f40-ac6957509ceb)\n\nI did this and got 100%.  My exam began about 20 mins after I finished this.\n\nStep 8.)  Take the OA.  Just do it.  This exam took me a while.  I think like an hour and 20 minutes total.  Once I got through all the questions I had about 19 questions bookmarked out of the 66 questions on the exam.  \"Yikes!\", I thought to myself, \"that's almost 1\/3 of the questions that I'm not sure on!\".  I went through them until I had only 9 or 10 left that were bookmarked, assumed I failed the exam, and clicked submit.  LOL but I actually passed.  \n\nThis is one of those exams where it's worth it to really think about the questions and the answers you're putting down.  Especially the legal\/ethical illegel\/unethical questions and the AI bias questions.\n\nAnyways, that's all folks.  Hope this helped.

Main thing is to make sure you read the material to completion to cover every topic. Focus on understanding HTML and CSS syntax, knowing the different CSS selectors and units of measurement, and know how CSS and HTML interact. This course mentions JavaScript but you don't need any JavaScript coding knowledge for the OA. The PA and OA are of similar difficulty but the OA is Loooong, or at least it feels that way.

They helped a lot and though I did fail a second time, the report showed that I improved in a handful of places. My second OA went horrible however and the moment I sat down I felt things were going to go badly.\n\nMy protector was extremely nitpicking, much more than the others I\u2019ve had in my other classes and my first attempt. She spent the first fifteen minutes complaining to me about the random kleenex box on the desk that I couldn\u2019t touch if I reached for it (and other things \ud83d\ude44) I know it\u2019s their job but how can anyone cheat with a kleenex box? I would really like to know. After that, it went downhill. I was flustered with her constant bickering of random things and she interrupted me a few times during the test. I was out of focus majority of the time, but that was probably more my fault than hers.\n\nAnyways, my question right now is what happens moving forward? I feel i\u2019m never going to get through this course. I wish they gave us an option, assign me some paper I\u2019ll ace that and write it in a day. But what the hell can I do? I\u2019m ready to give up, I\u2019m exhausted with it. I\u2019ve never studied so much, not even when I was in school. I also have a gripe that wether pass or fail of the OA, you aren\u2019t allowed to see what you got right and wrong. I understand for cheating purposes but I\u2019d like to at least know if I got certain questions correct. Telling me I did good on the 32% of one subject but failed at another 32% doesn\u2019t help me one bit. Did i fail that percent completely? Did i miss by one? \n\nThe study plan that my instructor assigned me for the second fail is literally the same as the first with a few things added.

They want to offer her a VP position as long as she can bring a list of the competitor's clients. The manager has a non-compete contract with the competitor company. The correct answer is \"unethical and illegal\"\n\nThe second question scenario is about an analyst working at a company and he was approved to find a part time job at another company. The second company is asking the analyst about some project he worked (but not require \/ mandatory that he answer, unlike question 1). The analyst is under an NDA so he cannot disclose anything. The correct answer here is \"unethical and legal\".\n\nFor Q1: would it be unethical and illegal because the company is coercing the manager to reveal confidential information in order to get the job she wanted (VP)? It's unethical because they know she has a noncompete and are asking for confidential info\n\nFor Q2: It's unethical because they ask about confidential info (thus putting the analyst in an bad position) but legal because they don't force him or threaten to fire him if he does not give up the answers?","permalink":"\/r\/WGU_Accelerators\/comments\/1ggb2xi\/d333_help_with_ethics_in_tech_practice_exam\/","created_utc":1730369749,"score":3,"text_length":1418,"vader_compound":-0.9911,"course_code":"D333"}

{"post_id":"1fqae4b","subreddit":"WGU_Accelerators","title":"Accounting Degree In 6 Months No Transfer Credits No Experience. ","selftext":"Just wanted to share this with anyone out there trying to figure out if its possible! The following is a summary of my experience and some tips I wish I had when I started!\n\n(sorry in advanced for all the typos and grammatical errors, this is meant to be informal, had enough formal writing with this degree lol)\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/x47cnfqkh8rd1.png?width=564&format=png&auto=webp&s=58713b67175068176d32bfde46fc646f732a7471\n\nI started on April 1st 2024 and finished on September 26th (tomorrow is my birthday! perfect timing)\n\nI am 19 (about to be 20 tomorrow) and I took a gap year from high school to figure out what I wanted to do. I felt kind of behind so I knew if I was going to get a degree I wanted to get it as fast as possible. I do not work full time, I had a food service job where I worked weekends totaling 16 hours a week. I put in on average 40 hours or more per week. I definitely procrastinated a LOT. The first month I only got 4 classes done, I didn't think 6 months was a realistic goal because I always read about people doing it in 6 months with transfer credits or with work experience. But after that first month something clicked in me and I became dedicated to finishing in 6 months.\n\nI was somewhat good at school, I graduated #8 in my class, I didn't do the college courses and honor classes towards the end of the school year because I thought college was a scam (only a scam if they take all your money and it takes 4 years or more lol). I just say this because I feel like some of the things I learned in school helped me get through most of the general education classes really quick, especially the science class we had in this course.\n\nThe mindset I had while I did these courses was that the general education isn't really that important. I would try to get those done as fast as possible. I wouldn't even read the material if possible. But on the actual accounting classes like Intermediate Accounting 1, 2, and 3 I actually read the through the whole book and watched all the videos. The only classes where I didn't read the material was Auditing D215 and Accounting Information Systems D217. I used the notes that were available in the resources and also watched the Edpsira videos for those. Those two classes were finished in 1 day. I remember auditing took me exactly 10 hours to complete. I am just saying this because there is a HUGE amount of people saying these courses are extremely difficult and I think its a bit over exaggerated. I wouldn't say they were easy but definitely not extremely hard. Just wanted to say this, because I was really unmotivated to get through them after reading everyone's experience.\n\nAlso read about some people saying the Business Law class (D216) was hard, but for that one you just have to watch the cohorts and thats it. The lady explains everything so well.\n\nOOOOOOOOO another life hack. ChatGPT. No this is not cheating, only dumb people use ChatGPT to cheat. This was the thing that helped me SOOOOOOOO MUCH. Basically if I didn't get a question right on the unit tests or PA I would screenshot it and ask ChatGPT why I got it wrong. If I still didn't understand I would keep going back and forth with it until I comprehended the topic. Its like talking to a professional that knows everything, beware though... sometimes it did not give me the right information. I'd say around 90% of the time the information it told me was correct. It helps to somewhat know what your are learning and being able to reference it from the text book to catch on to these mistakes. But the errors weren't major. I would just tell it that the test said the correct answer was this other answer choice and then it would correct itself.\n\nUm also I've seen people posting about perplexity being better than ChatGPT and I'm not sure about that. But I think the issue is I don't know how to use it. I pay for ChatGPT ($20 a month) so thats what I used. But today ChatGPT was down and I needed to study for my final OA D105 so I decided to give it a try since all WGU students get one year of the pro version of perplexity for free. I did not like it at all, but like I said i probably do not know how to use it. I couldn't find where I could have a conversation with the AI, it kept on referencing the first thing I brought up all the time idk. But if it works for you, use it!\n\nThe Performance Assessments were VERY EASY all the time! Its not that deep honestly, I was always so confused when mine got evaluated and I passed. Sometimes I felt like I didn't do to good of a job and it was going to be returned back to me but I always passed somehow. I think that they literally only care about the things listed on the rubric, which duh very obvious but idk. Just know its not that hard dont stress out. Do everything on the Rubric and you'll be fine. This is how I used chatGPT, I could copy and paste my essay and rubric and tell it to evaluate my essay based on the rubric provided. So yeah another little life hack for y'all. Oh and I HATE Grammarly idk why I just have a beef with them. I use QuillBot Grammar check, way better in my opinion. They catch more things than Grammarly.\n\nI energy drinks and coffee were definitely my friends these last 6 months. I drank Celsius energy drinks, the little packets you can mix with water. Very low calories so thats good. It's cause sometimes I would feel like I was reading but it wasn't going in my brain for some reason, so I would just drink one of those and It helped. Also towards the last 2 months I bought this gum called Neuro Gum, claims to give you energy and it has L-Theanine which helps you focus if you mix it with caffeine? I dont know, sounds silly but even if it was just a placebo effect they definitely helped. I pretended to use them like a \"magic pill\" that would make me smart.\n\nBut yeah thats all I could think about, just wanted to give some people advice I wish I would of had when I was first starting. I am not trying to brag, trust me.... I already did by posting about this on my Instagram story that 13 people saw so yeah lol. I'll try to answer a few questions if y'all have any. I plan on getting a job next month, already looking at a few things. Also starting my Masters Degree with WGU in November so yeah gonna be so much fun!

Managerial Accounting and Finance Skills For Managers I also passed on the first try. This class was no joke. I made sure I read ALL of the material. Every unit exam I got at least an 80. Some sections I used the extra practice to make sure I got the answers right. I watched the model 7 videos and had an okay understanding of the subject (VERY HELPFUL). I also took the practice exam that is new and in the supplemental resources (This was also a big help). I started on July 1st and took the PA last week. I studied and reviewed this week. Last night I felt I could not adsorb any more information. This morning I did a quick review and again, I just could not absorb anymore. Signed up to take the 1030 exam at 1029. Overall went well. Had a couple of questions where I worked and could not remember which formula to get the answer so I took a guess. The algebra I used the calculator for (thankfully i could put fractions into it). I used almost all of the allotted time. I probably could I have done better. I attended one live study session and that was before I hit module 7. I should have attended another one for module 7 concepts. Know association and causation. There were no conversion questions on my exam. Know scatter plots and what kind of graphs to use for what information. Know linear graphing and what graph goes with what formula (what graph is associated with y=-9x-6-example, not from exam).  I\u2019ve read posts that said the PA is nothing like the OA. I thought it was aligned. A little harder but still aligned. Just like the rest of the exams. But the supplemental practice exam I thought was a little tougher and help prepare me for the OA (first attempt I got a 63\/75 and second 69\/75). \nI could have reached out for help for the concepts I could not memorize.

{"post_id":"180no2j","subreddit":"WGU_Business","title":"Marketing Applications-VZT1 tips on how to pass the performance assessment","selftext":"Hello, I wanted to share some tips that helped me pass this P.A. because it was my first one and if you know where to look they really lay it out for you. ( I also got all green on the competencies)\n\n1. Watch the pre-recorded webinars or attend a live cohort. I watched the webinars. They are located under the \"Course tips\" and then you have to click on the blue linked word \"more\". An external link will open that will take you to the Pantopo pre-recorded webinars. The videos walk you through how to write your assessment by using examples and explaining things like the differences between objectives and strategies. \n2. USE THE TEMPLATE! There is a provided template at the bottom of the rubric page. You can export it to word. Enable editing. Then you can literally fill out the template as you are going through the webinars. \n3. I would recommend picking an electronic appliance\/device that already exists and that you are familiar with. I used the Nintendo Switch as mine. (I called it the Company G Switch Gaming Console). I was also able to find a SWOT analysis online to give me ideas. \n4. Use the examples for objectives, strategies, tactics, etc. that is given to you in the webinar videos just change the numbers. Just make sure it matches your product and it makes sense with your objectives. You might have to tweak them at the end of  filling out the charts\/template to make sure the strategies and tactics match the objectives. \n5. If you don't know what one of the parts of the template is or you're not sure how to write it like: SWOT analysis, objectives, strategies vs tactics, etc. REVIEW THE VIDEOS! (in the course material by pressing next and scrolling through until you see the linked videos or watching the webinars) \n6. For the tip above you can also search in the e-textbook keywords like SWOT Analysis. Chapter 16 is the chapter specifically on marketing applications that I used the most. \n7. FOLLOW THE RUBRIC RELIGIOUSLY! The rubric is what the graders literally use to grade you. So just go through the rubric as you are filling out the template and make sure you didn't miss a competency. And make sure you FULLY EXPLAIN YOURSELF. If you don't explain the WHY you chose to do something you wont get full points or none at all. For example: \"Company G has strong brand recognition BECAUSE many consumers recognize them for being innovative and reliable\". If that because isn't in there, the WHY, you won't get green on the competency. Just make sure you don't forget to explain. \n8. The instructor in the webinar says its ok so make assumptions or \"make stuff up\". You aren't going to know the numbers for company G or if this task should go to the marketing analyst or finance. But just give it your best guess. As long as you fill everything out and it seems reasonable that's all that matters. The graders aren't going to mark you down or debate you on if that task will go to the marketing analyst or if your target demographic is really middle aged women in urban areas. Don't sweat that stuff. They just want to see if you understand how to make a marketing plan not if this marketing plan is 100% accurate for the market and will be used.\n\nGood Luck! I hope this helps other people taking this course.

I would say I had more than 5 questions on this alone. \n\nThere was also quite a bit on interconnecting LANs. So know the difference between router, hubs, switches and what they do and where they fall on the models.\n\nAt least 4 questions on access points.\n\nA lot of questions on CIDR and subnet masks, hosts and subnets.

For reference I just came off completing an associate in IT in December which made me underestimate this course. I thought I could waltz in take the PA study a bit and take the QA. I did exactly that and failed the QA on my second day.

They pointed out a crash course YT playlist with a spreadsheet that correlates which videos cover which topic\/section of the book. That helped on topics I wanted a visual understanding of. If I would have done this from the get go I could have passed this class in 1-2 days easily. My gut tells me that if you have no prior experience this course should not be that difficult since it does not go super deep. Also I probably put in maybe 10-12 hours to this course. \n\nAlso after I failed my first QA my instructor gave me a study plan on the lessons I didn't meet the mark on which was a huge help.

There's no way around it.\n\nResources:\n\n* Lusby's webinars\n* [This Quizlet](https:\/\/quizlet.com\/323591503\/wgu-c952-flash-cards\/)\n* PA\n* Zybooks\n\nWhat I did:\n\nWatched all of Lusby's webinars. He does a good job explaining the basis for what's going to be included on the OA, but I wouldn't solely rely on it.\n\nNext, I went through the quizlet to memorize the vocabulary as much as I could initially handle. Once the vocab is engrained somewhat in my head, I used chatGPT to explain each vocab. What I did was grouped vocab words from the same concept or sections together. It's one thing to memorize the vocab, it's another thing to understand it. The **majority** of my time was going over vocabulary again and again.\n\nTook the PA. I failed, but went over the answer's from the PA video's to go over each question and really understand what the question is asking.\n\nAfter using chatGPT for the vocab, I took chunks out of the zybooks on things I was not familiar and told chatGPT to summarize and include a breakdown of certain concepts or equations. This really solidified my understanding.\n\nFinally, I just briefly skimmed through the suggested sections that will be on the OA. It was so much easier to go through the zybooks material now and it wasn't so overwhelming. I mostly focused grasping the underlying vocab and history sections that I felt would be important. You'll recognize most of the concepts already, but it should reinforce what you've already learned. These sections are suggested on the class resource page.\n\n* Chapter 2 Computer Abstraction \/ Technology: Sections 2.1 - 2.8\n* Chapter 3 Instructions:\u00a0\u00a0Sections 3.1 - 3.7\n* Chapter 4 Arithmetic for Computers:\u00a0\u00a0Sections 4.1 - 4.2, 4.6\n* Chapter 5 The Processor:\u00a0\u00a0Sections 5.1 - 5.9\n* Chapter 6 Memory Hierarchy:\u00a0\u00a0Sections 6.1 - 6.8, 6.11\n* Chapter 7 Parallel Processors:\u00a0\u00a0Sections 7.1 - 7.5\n\nTaking the OA wasn't as hard as people make it out be.  You can narrow down your answers to two and go from there. For the most part, It's very high level questions, but they will throw in a few historic or very oddly specific question you just either know or don't know. I did try to memorize the equations to the applied math problems, but just ended up getting overwhelmed and guessed some of the problems on the OA. So if you really understand those applied problems, they're easy points for ya.\n\nI had this class open for a while and wasn't prepared to dive into it due to lack of motivation. It took me around 5 days of studying to complete this class. This class was not as bad as DMII, but it's up there in terms of difficulty.","permalink":"\/r\/WGU_CompSci\/comments\/1j3z9zu\/c952_passed\/","created_utc":1741166855,"score":22,"text_length":2579,"vader_compound":0.5154,"course_code":"C952"}

I include this because it's probably why I feel the way I do; the OA was incredibly easy, and I spent way more time on this class then I should have. Even without the mentioned classes, I believe the content is not impossible to pick up, but I do agree that the readings are heavy and can probably make you feel like it's too much. \n\nI finished this class in 2 weeks. What I did was read the course material in full and complete the write in\/study guide? alongside the reading. The study guide can be accessed through the course community of this class. I also did most of the Quizzets, and I created my own separate flash cards based off of the Quizzets questions and included information from the chapter summaries in these flash cards as well. \n\nMy PA and OA aligned well, the questions were basically identical in what they were asking for, just the wording was different. You need to know the following:\n\n* Memory Managment techniques. You need to be able to differentiate between them and understand what each does.\n* Algorithm searching\n* Sorting; bubble sort, binary sort\n* What is a process, and what are its states? What is the difference between the ready state and the waiting state? What is a PCB?\n* Von Neumann Architecture; Control Unit, Memory Unit\n* Instruction Register VS Program Counter\n* Paradigms, what languages fit into X paradigm, and what are they?\n* General codes from the IEEE and the ACM code of ethics. \n* Understand Pseudocode, can you understand what it is doing? The pseudocode itself is basic, you just need to understand if-then, if-then-else, and count loops vs event loops. You may also get questions on picking the correct pseudocode for the problem it gives you. It is very basic selections and loops.\n* SDLC and the Computer Problem Solving Process, understand the phases and what they include, for example they may ask what phase is Bob in if he is translating pseudocode into a high level language\n* You need to be able to define an abstract data type\n* You need to understand abstract data structures, like a queue and a stack\n* You need to understand what multi-core processors do\n* What is an IOT device? Different types of computers like servers and a smartphone, the Zybooks for this is all you need.\n* A file, file systems. How does the file system interact with the OS?\n* Directories, Absolute path VS Relative Path, Root directory\n* What does an OS manage? What is the function of an Operating System?\n* Networks, what are the protocols, high level vs low level protocol, DNS, TLD, understand area networks like LAN, WAN, MAN, the topologies mentioned, like ring and bus, the mentioned network hardware and what they do\n\nThis isn't 100% everything you need to know, but it is a very good chunk. Most these areas are in the PA, and most likely a big portion of what is in the OA question pool. The Quizzets mostly aligned with the PA, which aligned with the OA (for me).

Of the 5 competencies, I scored competent on 3, approaching competence on 1 and unsatisfactory on 1. I then studied the course materials. This course relied a lot on textbook readings. For the material relevant to my two weak competencies I did the bulk of the reading, skimming through some sections that I was familiar with. For the other three competencies I started with the section quizzes, reviewing the readings on anything I wasn't confident in. The course material quizzes and test had a lot of similarities with the pre-assessment questions. After finishing the course materials, I retook the pre-assessment and scored exemplary in all competencies and scheduled my OA for 45 minutes later. In that time I reviewed the two ethics guidelines, the SDLC vs computer problem solving process, and some odds and ends that I had noted I felt less confident on during the pre-assessment. \n\n**The OA:** I found the OA to be more difficult than the previous materials. There were several questions with psuedo code blurbs as the answers instead of the question (as they were formatted previously). I felt prepared by the previous material for these but they definitely required more careful reading. I'm also glad I reviewed the two ethics guidelines, because several questions required a pretty specific recollection of those details. \n\nOverall, I found this course to be straightforward but the test was harder than the previous materials. I was surprised at the amount of this material was already familiar to me; having some personal experience with coding and general computer nerdery definitely helped. I spent about 9 hours total working on this course.\n\nCheck out mrkyngg's [post](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/WGU_CompSci\/comments\/1ik59uf\/d684_intro_to_cs_completed_in_less_than_a_week\/) on this course for another perspective and the videos they recommended. They're post gave me the confidence to jump into the OA while the information was fresh in my mind.\n\nComment with any questions you have for me about this course!

The materials are pretty easy reading, and a lot of the content felt like common sense so I was able to move through it quickly. I took most of the quizzes and tests in the materials, and found lots of those questions familiar from the pre-assessment. The OA was easy after reviewing all that material. Of the 50 multiple choice questions I revisited 5 or 6 before submitting. I recommend careful reading of the questions even if you are confident of the answer. For example, I got tripped up by the difference between \"speech recognition\" and \"voice recognition\" and the different-but-similar prompt refinement techniques. \n\n  \nOverall, I consider this class to be easy and I learned a bit about LLMs and image generating tools.

Just passed the OA first try with 1 exemplary and competency on rest. I do have prior knowledge, however this was my first WGU course and was a bit nervous for it. Total study time took 25-30 hours(likely double with no experience). \n\n**OA experience:**\n*Disclaimer - examples provided may or may not reflect actual questions in OA.*\nThe OA was very similiar to the PA. Most of the questions were same in OA, but written in reverse(ie - \u201cWhat is a FTP?\u201d vs \u201cWhich is a network protocol?\u201d). There were a handful of questions that were similar to PA, but for a different answer(ie - \u201cWhich are preemptive?\u201d Vs \u201cWhich are non preemptive?\u201d). I might of also missed a few questions due to how poorly they written the question.\n\n**Strategy:**\nI took the PA right away to see where I\u2019m at. I noted any subjects I lacked competency to review more later. The textbooks provided were rarely used with most of my time spent watching Crash Course videos. I used [this spreadsheet](https:\/\/docs.google.com\/spreadsheets\/d\/12TNwYB6hKuihqln87jjNCYpijzDqN9-yFloupAqNpKw\/edit?usp=drivesdk) that I found in the WGU CompSci discord which points to which Crash Course videos is related to each course chapter(*Shoutout to H4yT3r who made the spreadsheet*). This alone easily saved me HOURS of studying! For each subject, I reviewed all the Intros, summaries, and quizzes provided in Course Material once I was done with the relevant videos. ChatGPT to help explain terms with 45 minutes of flash cards to help memorize them. Reattempt PA, review questions and subjects I did poorly, then attempted until I was ready for OA. \n\n**Final Thoughts:**\nIt wasn\u2019t the easiest course, but by no means difficult and could help prepare for upcoming courses in BSCS. Read the questions and don\u2019t just assume you know what it\u2019s asking. Review definitions of terms you aren\u2019t sure about. Review SDLC, Gorge Poly 4 steps, and ACM\/IEEE Code of Conduct(infographic in provided course material). Quiz yourself often and reach out to your CI if you need additional tutoring! \n\n","permalink":"\/r\/WGU_CompSci\/comments\/1ik59uf\/d684_intro_to_cs_completed_in_less_than_a_week\/","created_utc":1738961261,"score":36,"text_length":2020,"vader_compound":0.9088,"course_code":"D684"}

This was the last class of my term ending this month. My life got pretty hectic at the start of the new year, so I didn\u2019t really start the class until 1\/20. I had to put in about 6 hours of studying every single day. Needless to say, I don\u2019t recommend doing that if you can avoid it lol.\n\nI used two main things for studying:\n\nThis post and the PA guide within it: https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/WGU\/comments\/1exyngm\/passed_d286_oa_java_fundamentals\/\n\nAnd the beginner Java course at CodeAcademy.\n\nI\u2019ve seen a lot of people say the ZyBooks for this class is pretty good. This wasn\u2019t the case for me, but different things work best for different people. As far as coding goes, I retain information best by immediately trying to code myself as soon as I learn a new concept. The ZyBooks is set up to have you read the entire chapter, do a couple multiple choice questions, and then do a coding lab to apply the concepts. By the time I reached the labs I had basically forgotten everything. If you learn the same way as me, I would highly recommend the CodeAcademy course instead. I only finished about 75% of it but that was more than enough to get comfortable with everything.\n\nThe OA is extremely similar to the PA, it just uses different variables or arithmetic expressions. There were a couple questions on the PA that didn\u2019t show up on the OA at all for me. Instead I had two questions of the same concept. Ex: I had two different versions of the field\/constructor\/method question (Q12 on the PA), but no questions about integer division (Q3 on the PA). Overall though if you can do the PA practice questions in chapter 20 of the ZyBooks and understand the concept basics, you\u2019ll be fine.","permalink":"\/r\/WGU_CompSci\/comments\/1ieqb5c\/d286_java_fundamentals_passed\/","created_utc":1738360069,"score":27,"text_length":1728,"vader_compound":0.9779,"course_code":"D286"}

I'm not an accelerator and am trying to absorb the information and develop skills and learn. I don't have a huge background in math other than a stats course here and there in undergrad and in my social sciences grad program. I am taking the program with a veterans benefit, mostly to learn but also to upskill and continue growing.\n\nI took a few months to do DM1, but that's not really instructive because I switched jobs and moved 6,000 km halfway through. Without that, I still think I would've taken a while, especially because I think this is one of the more important courses and I wanted to adsorb the material. Here's what I did:\n\nI read the entire ZyBooks and did all of the quizzes, tests, and exercises therein. Then I took the PA to gauge how I was doing because it's a lot of material. I got just over competent with some lacking in a few areas but this helped me focus. I then went through the supplemental worksheets, unit reviews, and a few of the Kimberly Brehm and TrevTutor videos. However, what I did while doing that was created a NotebookLM with most of those videos + core texts in Discrete Math used in MIT's open courseware. I think maybe about four textbooks and forty or so videos. I would converse with NotebookLM about areas I needed to work on and ask it to explain topics. I didn't do any practice questions beyond the supplemental worksheets. I read through the Discord a bit, but apart from a few wonderful souls helping people out, it is mostly a lot of people complaining about having to study difficult math (at least on the DM1 thread..., no shade, people need an outlet, I get it). I did all this for about a week, then did the PA again and did very well. I didn't trust that because I remembered some of the questions, but I did the OA the next day and did better than I thought I would.\n\nIn terms of difficulty, I agree with others that the OA is about 20% more difficult than the PA. Based on my personal experience I would order the difficulty of the materials as such, from least to most difficult: Unit Reviews < PA < Supplemental Worksheets < Course Planning Tool < OA. \n\nBest of luck to everyone looking to do this course. Personally I found it rewarding because I think it will help having the course's concepts in my mind when it comes to doing DSA material.","permalink":"\/r\/WGU_CompSci\/comments\/1i5f7wm\/c959_discrete_mathematics_1\/","created_utc":1737337864,"score":24,"text_length":2437,"vader_compound":0.9566,"course_code":"C959"}

I was frustrated because I knew as soon as I make a bunch of garbage up they would send it back to be revised and tell me how what I made up wasn\u2019t what they wanted me to make up.

This course is you making shit up.\n\nWithout being too specific, I literally wrote my paper and one of my solutions to their problem was what I at first believed to be mythical and not a realistic solution, but by golly, my company would provide it.

All in all, pretty sure the effort took fewer than 40 hours, but it helped to have time for the material to sink in. For some context, I took DMI on SDC, and I'm an experienced software engineer, which helped with some sections.\n\nI tried a variety of resources after reading some study guides on here (grateful for y'all!). In the end, what really worked for me was to go through the supplementary worksheet. I gave up on the zybook pretty quickly, and I also quickly got bored watching all the videos on youtube. If that's also you, you can do what I did and basically just learn by doing the worksheet. \n\nI try to answer each question, if I feel solid about the topic, I move on, if not, I will then go to youtube or chatgpt to learn how to solve questions like it, then try again. If you can feel solid about 80% of the worksheet, you will have no problems in my opinion. \n\nChatgpt really came in clutch for me here. Discrete probability was a weak spot of mine, and I just had it quiz me over and over again until I felt comfortable. Got full marks on this section!\n\nOnce I got through the worksheet, I took the PA and got a competent. Then I scheduled an appointment with a CI to go over questions I didn't understand after trying myself. \n\nI didn't have to do too much studying after that. I mostly just scanned over my completed worksheet a couple times. I feel like it wasn't really hard to retain the information after you understand each concept, and the given formula sheet helps with the things that need to be memorized. \n\nI only did this for a couple units, but I would join the live cohorts just to get the extra problem sets they give out. Maybe you can ask CIs for that too.\n\nThe OA was 62 questions(!) and I managed to finish with about 20 minutes to spare. It felt tight. It was about the same level of difficulty as the PA for me, but there were questions I had never seen before. I concur with others that say move on and come back later when you hit a questions that you don't immediately know or will take a while.\n\nI installed omnicalc but didn't even use it. The only thing I used on my calculator other than basic arithmetic was nCr, already there by default. IMO, this step was unnecessary.\n\nBottom line is, don't be intimidated by this class. Just try to understand one concept at a time, and you're there before you know it.

{"post_id":"1hfnvzs","subreddit":"WGU_CompSci","title":"Accelerating CS - Two weeks in and going strong","selftext":"Two weeks into CS at WGU and I'm feeling good so far. Still lots to do, but I figured I could jump into the subreddit and share some progress and how I have gone about it so far.\n\n**My story**\n\nMid-thirties. I have been working as a web developer both freelance and as an employee for about 10 years total. I also run a small SaaS and have a prior career in marketing. I had a slow year with my freelancing so I decided to pursue the CS degree. I'm thinking of transitioning back to full-time work after being independent for the past 5 years.\n\n  \n**My goal**\n\nThis degree started mostly as a fallback plan to be eligible to work in the US via a TN visa if I cannot find work at a salary that I'm happy with in Canada. We have a low ceiling here compared to the US. My partner and I love it here, so it would be difficult to leave, but that's a separate discussion. I wanted to accelerate the program by focusing on it full-time over one single term instead of stretching it out over multiple while working.  \n\n\n**Transfers**\n\nOne of the screenshots shows what I transferred in. My Canadian university bachelors degree only transferred English, Comms, and Stats. International bachelors degrees are not eligible for transferring the other general credits that a US degree normally covers. I was not happy to learn this after months of waiting on a transcript evaluation from WES, but it is what it is.\n\nSo the other courses in that screenshot were all transferred from Sophia. Most were pretty easy except calculus, which I forgot is insanely difficult since I last studied it 15 years ago.\n\n**Courses taken so far**\n\nAnother screenshot shows basically the order of how I tackled these courses. I think I actually had the two security courses back to back, and that was helpful since they share some of the same course information (CIA triad for example).\n\nAmerican Politics may have taken me the longest just due to the sheer amount of content I needed to memorize, but go find other reddit posts on each course whenever possible and they will help guide you through the best way to study.\n\n**My general approach**\n\nNothing new here.\n\n\\- Search posts on reddit for the specific course guides. Sometimes the course number changes (like D459 systems thinking - used to be something else) so you should search for both the course name and the course number separately in case nothing comes up.\n\n\\- I tried tackling all the easy and\/or boring stuff first so I could gain momentum and carry it into the harder stuff\n\n\\- I am trying to pair similar courses so I am in the X mindset already. Like I will do discrete math 1 right before discrete math 2, take security courses together, etc.\n\n\\- I keep a Notion database with a note for each class in the program where I store any links to resources for the course like reddit posts, quizlets, youtube videos, and then I generally add a note inside with my study notes. (Heads up - I'm not looking to share these and a lot of how I take notes would be complete non-sense to other people anyway, so please no message to request the notes.)\n\n\\- Lots of videos a 1.5x speed\n\n\\- Personally I learn\/retain best by writing stuff down, rather than simply reading it. So I write down bullet points as I go. I may or may not ever come back to read them, but the act of writing alone has helped.\n\n\\- Being disciplined and saying \"no\" to other things in life. I have declined invites to do things from friends etc because I knew I needed a strong start. I have some ADHD tendencies, and if I foster that energy in the right way I can use my hyper-focus as an advantage, but it has been known to bite me in the ass, so I gotta watch for this.\n\n\\- Set smaller goals along the way. Sometimes my goal is \"finish this class today\" others it is \"finish 5 classes this week\" and one of my goals was to reach 50% completion by end of the second week. It's daunting to see how many classes are left still, but breaking it into chunks really helps me to stay motivated.\n\n**What I am most nervous about moving forward**\n\n\\- Hands down the discrete math courses, and also the new AI courses that have no info on them yet.\n\n**Wrapping up**\n\nAnyways - this isn't an approach for everyone. I have a lot of experience in this field already, though I will say a lot of the content I have learned so far has been more about general memorization than relying on past experience, so I think many people could get through a lot of these classes without a ton of tech experience. From where I am now, there's mostly technical classes left, and that's where I expect to lean more heavily on my past experience in the field.\n\nHope this post is helpful in some way for somebody in the future. I've gotten a lot out of the WGU reddit community so far, and I just wanted to share a bit back. Plus it feels like a valid form of procrastination lol. Better get back to it. Good luck everyone!  \n\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/dxt4l08nl87e1.png?width=984&format=png&auto=webp&s=9135996934627af208388f2e69181077632fa09e\n\n[Progress in two weeks - about 25&#37; of program CUs, but leaning towards easy credits first](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/5jyjq8bul87e1.png?width=2624&format=png&auto=webp&s=65e33754179ea6b8c3b89da9d65cf3918b56b99a)\n\n[Credits I transferred in via Sophia and my previous university studies.

I actually quite enjoyed the information and it was stuff I truly had never had exposure with so it was fun to learn something entirely new. It took me a cumulative of 6 weeks to finish this course over 2.5 months dealing with work trips and family stuff.\n\n**Observations**\n\n1. The textbook is annoyingly quite helpful. As ZYBooks tend to be, it's very dense and goes into strong detail on many things but as you'll find on the course homepage you will not be tested on it all.\n2. Jack Lusby's lectures are good but I'll caution you, he actually skips a lot of stuff you really should know. More on this below\n3. The Quizlet is reasonable but the creator didn't proof many of the prompts and I found it a little hard to use.\n4. There is a contraband study guide still out in the wild, at the time of writing it I found it here: [https:\/\/ashejim.github.io\/BSCS\/C952.html](https:\/\/ashejim.github.io\/BSCS\/C952.html)\n5. The instructors are very active on this class in my experience, I didn't reach out to them for this particular class but I was impressed overall with the engagement.\n\n**If I took this course again from scratch here is what I would do:**\n\n1. In the course homepage locate the \"Competency\" list of chapters and sections, read and take useful notes on all of those sections. It's a slog but just do it. Take the little quizes on the ZYBook the accompany, use ChatGPT to get clarifications, use tiktok\/youtube shorts for brief reviews of concepts.\n2. After each corresponding section, watch the Lusby lecture to accompany your note taking but DO NOT solely rely on his videos. Also speed them up to max speed because he talks quite slow. And says \"latest and greatest\" at the start of most videos... It's very reasonable to plan a section set and Lusby lecture per day. That is an attainable goal and will help split up the large quantity of information.\n3. When you are done with all of that, use Quizlet to review all of the terms with the learning mode on.\n4. Take the PA\n5. Review with the PA as your guide to generally what sections you are lagging behind on. There's really no point in taking it again IMO.\n6. The contraband study guide above, additional PA's in the same post as the study guide, and a review of the calculations should get you in a good firing position for OA.\n\nThe OA I had was a rather even distribution of application vocab (about 50%), easier calculations (20%), Random history (15%), and then random things from the deep corners of the textbook like PCI-e speed comparisons...

{"post_id":"1grr619","subreddit":"WGU_CompSci","title":"Guide to Passing WGU C952: In Depth Tips, Tricks, and What You Need to Know (2024)","selftext":"# No-Nonsense Guide to Passing This Course\n\nThis guide is direct, honest, and to the point. I passed the OA on my first attempt tonight, November 14th 2024.\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/yn92l5val01e1.png?width=897&format=png&auto=webp&s=6f57bb9459ee93b919bb0cded83850d9e5a713af\n\nHere\u2019s the breakdown of what you need to focus on.\n\n# Test Overview\n\n* **70% of the OA**: Vocab, history, and conceptual understanding.\n   * Focus on memorizing terms, historical context, and theoretical questions. Don't underestimate how critical this portion is.\n* **30% of the OA**: Arithmetic, logical operations, pipelining, conditional branches, and machine language problems.\n   * This section can work for or against you based on how well you\u2019ve studied and understood the material.\n\n# The 70%: Conceptual Questions\n\n* **Heavy emphasis on vocab and history**:\n   * Make sure you memorize concepts, history, and terminology thoroughly. Quizlet flashcards are a lifesaver here.\n   * Examples of key areas:\n* Chapter 1 Welcome:\n* Chapter 2 Computer Abstraction \/ Technology: Sections 2.1 - 2.8\n* Chapter 3 Instructions:\u00a0\u00a0Sections 3.1 - 3.7\n* Chapter 4 Arithmetic for Computers:\u00a0\u00a0Sections 4.1 - 4.2, 4.6\n* Chapter 5 The Processor:\u00a0\u00a0Sections 5.1 - 5.5, I didn't read past 5.5 and didn't see but one question on the OA from chapter 5, so you can skip through most of 5.\n* **\\*\\*Chapter 6 Memory Hierarchy\\*\\***: Focus heavily on virtual machines, virtual memory, page tables, page faults, cache operations, and the Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB), RAID. Chapter 6 was focused on heavily in the OA and probably was the most over represented chapter, but you need only read **Sections 6.1 - 6.8, 6.11**.  The rest was a waste and not on the OA.\n* Chapter 7 Parallel Processors:\u00a0\u00a0Sections 7.1 - 7.3, the rest you can skip\\* Skip most of Chapter 5\u2014it\u2019s not relevant to the OA.\n\n# The 30%: Applied Problems\n\n* Focus on **arithmetic and logic**:\n   * **Binary calculations**:\n      * Base conversions (binary \u2194 decimal), binary arithmetic (add, subtract, divide), two\u2019s complement, and overflow detection.\n   * **Assembly language**:\n      * Understand and interpret logical, conditional, and arithmetic instructions.\n   * **CPU performance**:\n      * Memorize all CPU time and performance formulas, especially from 2.6.8 to 2.6.10. Despite what you may hear, you **must** memorize these formulas\u2014they won\u2019t be provided during the OA.\n      * **\\*\\*Key formulas\\*\\*** MEMORIZE THESE, THEY WILL NOT BE PROVIDED TO YOU ON OA:\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/fpf9dnikn01e1.png?width=609&format=png&auto=webp&s=4efea8eaaf82d2198fa33dfac26fe03596947ea6\n\n* **Pipelining**: \\* Expect at least three pipeline-related questions.  For the pipeline scenarios on the OA use the following formula \n\nTotal\u00a0Time=(Time\u00a0for\u00a0the\u00a0Slowest\u00a0Step)\u00d7(Number\u00a0of\u00a0Items\u22121)+Sum\u00a0of\u00a0All\u00a0Step\u00a0Durations\n\nFor example: You're asked to determine how long it takes to wash, dry, and fold four loads of laundry using a pipelining approach, given the following information:\n\n* One washer takes 30 minutes\n* One dryer takes 40 minutes\n* One folder takes 20 minutes\n\nApplying the formula you have (40 mins dryer) x (four loads of laundry - 1) + (30 mins washer+40 mins dryer+20 mins fold)\n\n(40 x 3) + 90 = 210 minutes.  So the answer is 210 minutes with pipelining.  \n\n# Study Tips\n\n1. **Webinars by Professor Jack Lusby**:\n   * These are essential, but not because they teach the material well. Instead, they\u2019ll save you time by showing what\u2019s important for the OA and what isn\u2019t.\n   * Key takeaway: Whenever Lusby says, \u201cwe\u2019re going into the weeds here,\u201d you can skip that material\u2014it won\u2019t be on the OA.\n2. **Quizlet Flashcards**:\n   * Use them to nail the vocab and history questions. They\u2019ll cover most of the 70% of the test. [Quizlet Link](https:\/\/quizlet.com\/323591503\/wgu-c952-flash-cards\/)\n\n# OA vs. PA\n\n* The OA is slightly harder than the PA but covers the same material. Questions on the OA are often worded awkwardly, so you\u2019ll need strong **deductive reasoning** to eliminate wrong answers.\n* If you passed the PA, take extra time to firm up your understanding of the material before tackling the OA. The two days I spent reviewing after the PA made a difference.\n\n# Common Mistakes to Avoid\n\n1. **Wasting Time**:\n   * Don\u2019t overthink formulas or dive too deep into irrelevant sections like Chapter 5.\n   * Stick to the formulas and chapters listed here. Many of the chapters in this book over explain things and go way too deep into the weeds on subjects of which won't be covered on the OA.\n2. **Underestimating the Vocab and History**:\n   * While it seems trivial, this section is heavily weighted. Don\u2019t slack on memorization.\n3. **Not Memorizing Key Formulas**:\n   * You must know these by heart. They won\u2019t be provided.\n\n# Final Thoughts\n\nIf I were to start over, knowing what I know now, I could have passed this course with a week of focused studying, dedicating about 4 hours per day. It took me two and a half weeks.  Unfortunately, I made the mistake of trusting advice from someone on Reddit who claimed they passed the class in just a few days by watching YouTube videos. That turned out to be a complete waste of two valuable days, as none of that material was relevant. This was a hard lesson in sticking to reliable sources, zyBooks is all you need for this course. While outside tutorials on YouTube might work for other classes, this is not one of them. Save yourself the time and frustration: stick to zyBooks, stay consistent, and you\u2019ll be glad you did.\n\n1. Memorize the CPU formulas and practice binary calculations.\n2. Nail down vocab, history, and concepts. **IMPORTANT** if you're not reading the whole chapter you still must scan and read the bold and highlighted blue definitions as well as read the fallacy and pitfall sections.\n3. Watch Lusby\u2019s webinars to streamline your study plan.\n\nI've shown a screenshot of all the fallacy and pitfall sections you have to read\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/01bv2etpp01e1.png?width=1014&format=png&auto=webp&s=faf20f0b76a82d4329cf474f98a440a441c9f338\n\nThis test is about balancing **conceptual understanding (70%)** with **applied problem-solving (30%)**. Focus on these areas, and you\u2019ll pass confidently.\n\nGood luck!","permalink":"\/r\/WGU_CompSci\/comments\/1grr619\/guide_to_passing_wgu_c952_in_depth_tips_tricks\/","created_utc":1731656178,"score":54,"text_length":5800,"vader_compound":0.9869,"course_code":"C952"}
{"post_id":"1gpv55i","subreddit":"WGU_CompSci","title":"D281 Linux Foundations - LPI Linux Essentials Exam Study Plan","selftext":"Just took the LPI Linux Essentials exam after 5 days of studying. I had no prior experience with Linux. Just wanted to share a few observations\/thoughts for anyone who is preparing for this exam:\n\n* I felt like I was acing the exam as I took it, but ended up with a much lower score than I anticipated (630\/800), which makes me suspect there was a trick question or two.\n* I consider myself to be a good test taker and good at cramming, but I think 5 days of work is just about right for this exam. I assumed others on reddit were exaggerating the difficulty of the exam. To some degree they were, but at the same time there is validity to what they were saying. The exam isn't easy and does require you to know your stuff. But I think 5 solid days of studying is just about right.\n* Per the recommendations of others, here is the best use of your time:\n   * First, watch Shawn Powers' Linux Essentials playlist on YouTube. Found [here](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/playlist?list=PL78ppT-_wOmvlYSfyiLvkrsZTdQJ7A24L). This is a good primer on Linux. He has a great energy and passion that keeps you engaged.\n   * Next, complete the Cisco Linux course found [here](https:\/\/www.netacad.com\/courses\/linux-essentials?courseLang=en-US). This will revisit some of the topics from Shawn's playlist as well as touch on new topics. It will go into more detail. Complete all the quizzes and exams. I didn't complete all the labs but I would recommend it to help lock things into your mind. I don't think I spent anywhere near 70 hours on the course, so don't let that number daunt you. You can choose how long you want to spend going through the material. As you go through the course, I encourage you to constantly be experimenting and typing things into the virtual command line. This is how you will really ingrain things in your mind. Be curious about how various commands would work. Experiment.\n   * Now you are ready to practice for the exam. Once you have finished all quizzes and exams available with the Cisco course, move to Udemy. Take all six exams under the course title of: \"LPI Linux Essentials 010-160 (6 Practice Exams).\" You can access for free using the WGU Udemy portal. Lastly, take the 80 question exam located [here](https:\/\/www.proprofs.com\/quiz-school\/story.php?title=mtq1mtq2oqtx8h). For all the exams, go through the questions you got wrong and understand why. Now here is something that was a pleasant surprise for me - some of the questions from the various exams I linked actually appeared verbatim on my real exam. Not sure why. I suppose LPI released some questions from their test bank. Not complaining.\n   * If you did all of the above, you will be looking really good, but if you aren't the best test taker or don't have the best memory, the last thing you could do (which I didn't) would be to practice your memorization on Quizlet. Here are three solid Quizlets that I wanted to use but didn't.\n      * [https:\/\/quizlet.com\/606546170\/lpi-linux-essentials-010-160-flash-cards\/](https:\/\/quizlet.com\/606546170\/lpi-linux-essentials-010-160-flash-cards\/)\n      * [https:\/\/quizlet.com\/564443374\/wgu-c851-linux-foundations-flash-cards\/?i=5522jx&x=1jqY](https:\/\/quizlet.com\/564443374\/wgu-c851-linux-foundations-flash-cards\/?i=5522jx&x=1jqY)\n      * [https:\/\/quizlet.com\/569294428\/lpi-linux-essentials-010-160-flash-cards\/?i=4ldif7&x=1jqY](https:\/\/quizlet.com\/569294428\/lpi-linux-essentials-010-160-flash-cards\/?i=4ldif7&x=1jqY)\n\nDon't fall into the complaining and negativity like some others have. The exam is fair. Just make sure you are prepared by following the above steps. Let me know if you have any questions.

{"post_id":"1g9vckj","subreddit":"WGU_CompSci","title":"C959 - Discrete Math 1 - Just finished, thoughts","selftext":"So I just finished DM1 with a 82% (41\/50) last night (at that's what it says if you inspect the grading bar graphic), and I'd like to shave some thoughts \n\n1st:  Save the additional resources offline.  Just because it's kind of annoying to click through a bunch of links to load up web versions of pdfs.  I also converted the PA alignment spreadsheet into a pdf for offline viewing.\n\n2nd: The Zybook while tedious does have everything you need, however there are a few sections that I wish they had put more detail in\n\n3rd: The OA is about 20% harder than the PA and a good chunk of that is due to vocabulary, syntax and covering of topics that weren't touched in the PA or even the additional practice problems.\n\n4th: A calculator is not required, BUT it does make things a lot easier.  I use a Casio FX-9750GIII.  I used this calculator for Calculus 1 and this class, and while it's not on the official list specifically, it does meet all the qualifications from WGU.  My proctor wasn't familiar with it, so I said it was comparable to the TI-84 and the proctor understood.  It goes for $60 brand new on Amazon versus $100 for a TI-84.  It's a little different to use but once you get used to it it's great.\n\n5th: The calculator makes Matrix, Boolean Algebra and Summation Notation problems MUCH quicker.  To be clear, learn how to do these by hand, and once you feel comfortable, learn how to do them in the calculator, it saves so much time.  It also prevents simple mistakes causing you to pick the a wrong answer as the wrong MC answers often rely on mistakes in sign or steps.  The manual for your graphing calculator gives exact instructions.\n\n6th: Unit 1 and 2 comprise of 19 of the 50 questions, making them a major priority.  This is a bless and a curse.  Taking extra time to practice manually writing out truth tables and understanding Set symbols will help a lot.  Power Sets are something that youll end up overlooking and go 'god dammit' later, at least I did.  Understanding subset and proper subsets is important and my biggest regret was not spending more time memorizing 1.21 - Rules of Inference.  They aren't on the formula sheet and you'll need them.  Also proofs, fucking proofs,  knowing the terms such as \"proof by cases\" and what not is vital.\n\n7th: Memorizing the terms related to walk, trail, cycle, circuit etc will save you from making mistakes in Unit 7.\n\n8th: There is no one single YouTube Channel that pairs perfectly with this course.  Discrete Math is sadly not consistent with how universities break up the 1st and 2nd class when they offer two of them and it's quite evident when searching for playlists.  I used Kimberly Brehm, TrevTutor, the Udemy list the instructors provided and looking up specific topics directly on YouTube as some were still missing.  \n\n9th: I did every participation activity and exercise, but skipped the zybooks practice problems at first.  My goal was to get an overview of everything, and make note of sections that I think I would need to go back and practice and kept going.  When I finished everything, I took the PA, compared it to the PA alignment chart and my own notes and then focused in on those sections by doing the Zybook practice problems.  I also took the supplemental question worksheets and split them in half to create two practice PAs of I think it was 40 questions each.\n\n10th: There were 5 additional problems on my OA, your amount may vary but just keep in mind that you need to 14 seconds faster on avg per question than you would think.  \n\n11th: Skip the tedious problems on the OA at first, bookmark them and come back, knock out all the ones you can quickly do on the whiteboard, in your head or on the calculator, so you can focus more time on the difficult questions at the end.  That way your anxiety doesn't make you mess up what should be Gimme problems because you're low on time.\n\n12th: In the corner of my whiteboard I like to make a \"Right\", \"Maybe\", \"Wrong\" table and tally up the problems as I go through the test.  By assuming I get \"1 question point\" on the \"right\", and \"0.5 question point\" on the \"maybe\".  I find I get pretty close to my real score and it helps you realize what kind of pace you're on. Once I crossed 40 points out of the possible 55, my stress levels notably dropped as I felt I was finally above the margin of error, this is helped me in a lot of exams over the years.\n\n13th: Print out the provided formula sheet, you can't use it on the test (a digital one is provided) but it's just easier for studying.  I also printed a random Discrete Math Cheatsheet I found for quick lookup of stuff.\n\n14th: Alternatively, copy and paste into a word document the summary section at the bottom of every zybooks section to make your own.\n\n15th: ChatGPT was helpful to explain certain practice problems but copy\/paste doesn't work great, you'll need to double check symbols like missing fraction lines.  4-mini was more helpful than the main ChatGPT4.  It can be wrong though, so just be careful.\n\n16th: I would have loved if I had remembered to buy new Colored Dry Erase markers before the OA as all black lines can get visually messy on graphs.\n\n17th: A Digital Artist Glove is super helpful for the whiteboard.  These are small two finger gloves designed to keep skin oils off of digital drawing tablets.  Work perfectly for whiteboards so the oils don't mess with the markers, and they're just a few bucks on Amazon.  Proctor had no issue once I explained what it was \n\nOverall, it's not a necessarily difficult class but there's a lot of topics that require manual calculations or just concepts that you've probably never had in other courses.  Take your time, it's far easier than Calculus 1 was.","permalink":"\/r\/WGU_CompSci\/comments\/1g9vckj\/c959_discrete_math_1_just_finished_thoughts\/","created_utc":1729637117,"score":36,"text_length":5727,"vader_compound":0.9623,"course_code":"C959"}

{"post_id":"1fsjoop","subreddit":"WGU_CompSci","title":"D286 - Java Fundamentals Guide from Someone with no Experience with Java or Coding","selftext":"Unlike some phenoms here, it took me months to take this exam and pass it after failing the first attempt. Here is how I learned it as a newb. I followed the advice of another redditor and utilized chatGPT to break down not only the answers but also the questions. If you don't understand the questions how will you answer on the exam? You will need to learn new vocab such as methods, static, etc. Here is what you will need to focus on to pass the exam since there are differences:\n\n-Know how to use doubles and Double.valueOf(); for question #10.\n\n-For question 2, know how to do subtraction and addition version. As well as odd numbers. Subtraction uses -=. addition uses +=. Here is my simple version: (Yes this scores 100%). Question #5 can be greatly simplified too.  \nint startingNum = scnr.nextInt();\n\nint multiplier = scnr.nextInt();\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < 3; i ++) {\n\nstartingNum \\*= multiplier;\n\nSystem.out.print(startingNum + (i < 2 ? \" \" : \"\\\\n\"));\n\n}\n\n}\n\n}\n\n* to check for even: if (sum % 2 ==0){ (sum divided by 2 is equal to 0 because it is an even #.)\n* to check for odd: if (sum % 2 != 0){ (sum divided by 2 is not equal to 0, meaning it is an odd #. != not equal).\n* (I refer to this as division but it is actually called modulo. \"It gives the remainder after integer division.\" Thank you for the correction lost12487.\n\n-memorize difference between if, for, else, while. if is to check a condition. for is to do an incrementing loop. While keeps looping until condition is not true.\n\n* for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++){ this starts i at 0. It loops 3x. Keep in mind you may have to increase this on the exam to loop more. Remember how it works. It's used on multiple questions. #8 uses it twice and that question on the exam is a doozy. Practice different versions of #8 using chatGPT.\n\n-Know how to use Boolean and int on question #9. Instead of true false true as an output it wanted an integer output. I got this one wrong.\n\n-Know how to get product and largest value on question #7. Instead of Integer.MAX\\_VALUE;, use Integer.MIN\\_VALUE;. Also set product to = 1 instead of 0 like it is for the sum in the PA version.\n\n-When you are setting a method you use public void. When you get the method it's public (string, int, double, etc). Setting example: public void setName(String name){this.name = name;}. public String getName(){return name;}. Notice for getting the () parentheses are empty because you said String already.\n\n-Make sure to count out the spaces properly on #1.\n\n-There is no copy and paste with Meazure lock down lol. Typing everything out SUCKS.\n\n-If you learn methods, getting, setting, etc. You will get 10-14 correct. Just make sure to remember how to use different values with strings like mentioned above. Integer.valueOf, double.valueOf, etc.\n\n-Take the PA and solve the q's after studying the code a bit and if you can't remember try to solve it anyways I was able to greatly simplify my code this way. You can also keep { } these on the same line to make it cleaner. Such as when you are getting, setting, returning, etc.\n\n* Also make flash cards of each bit of code to help you remember what it does. I also had cards to remind me of the full code.\n* Arrays are used on both question #6 and question #8 so make sure you understand how that works. You will need to organize it a bit differently so make sure you know. I use String fullName = scnr.nextLine(); and String\\[\\] parts = fullName.split(\" \"); String firstName = parts\\[0\\]; (in coding we start with 0 instead of 1. So the first name is 0). Try other versions of this question to be safe.\n* keep the solutions as simple as possible so it's easier to remember it on the exam. You can use chatGPT and the practice questions in the text book to make sure the answer will score 100%. Also make sure to add a line at the end when the question asks for it.\n* If you get to the level of forgetting the solution, but are able to troubleshoot it and use the output to fix the issue you are golden. There are multiple ways to solve the questions. Use print statements to check your work and debug when you are lost. Keep trying on the exam even if you think you won't figure it out...I eventually got it to work.\n\nLastly, not sure how people without extended exam time will fare on this now that there is no copy and paste with Meazure learning. I hope they will change this because it's just stupid lol.","permalink":"\/r\/WGU_CompSci\/comments\/1fsjoop\/d286_java_fundamentals_guide_from_someone_with_no\/","created_utc":1727658294,"score":21,"text_length":4473,"vader_compound":0.9936,"course_code":"D286"}
{"post_id":"1fqlv4f","subreddit":"WGU_CompSci","title":"My Review of Computer Science 204: Database Programming on Study.com","selftext":"This is the second course I've completed through [Study.com](http:\/\/Study.com) as part of my credit transfer process for Data Management - Applications (D427) at WGU. I managed to finish the course in about six days, dedicating 4 to 8 hours each day. To maintain consistency, I set a goal to complete at least two chapters per day and took notes on key concepts.\n\nThe course consists of 12 chapters and approximately 85 quizzes, although one chapter only includes an assignment. Prior to this, my only experience with SQL was the Sophia Database course, where I didn\u2019t actually run queries. This course introduced me to MySQL for the first time, and I learned a lot.\n\n**Downloading MySQL:**\n\nAs part of the course, I needed to download a SQL relational database management system. At the end of chapter one, instructions were provided to download MySQL, which I did. Since I have a Mac, the process was a bit more complicated than on Windows. While they recommended using VirtualBox or Docker, claiming that \"installing MySQL on a Mac can be challenging,\" I found it easier to install MySQL directly on my Mac rather than go through those extra steps.\n\nI downloaded MySQL from the MySQL Community Server Link [here](https:\/\/dev.mysql.com\/downloads\/mysql\/) . However, I had to download MySQL Workbench separately, as no directions were given for that. You can download that [here](https:\/\/dev.mysql.com\/downloads\/workbench\/). Then, go to your system settings, search for MySQL, make sure your MySQL server is started, and click \"Initialize Database.\" You'll have to set up a root password, so make sure it's one that you can remember. These steps will allow you to correctly use MySQL Workbench and connect to the local instance without errors.\n\n**Quizzes:**\n\nBefore starting, I took the placement test for Computer Science 303: Database Management, which allowed me to skip a few quizzes in this course. For each chapter, I alternated between reading the lessons or watching the videos (at 2x speed), followed by the quizzes. I aimed for a perfect score on each quiz and would retake them until I achieved 100%. Each quiz consisted of about five questions and allowed three attempts. If I didn\u2019t score 100%, I\u2019d open a new tab to retry the quiz and cross-check the previous attempts to see what I got wrong.\n\nAfter completing some quizzes, I noticed that quizzes in other chapters would sometimes automatically be marked as completed with a score of 5\/5.\n\nAdditionally, at the end of most chapters, there was a lesson without a quiz, but it included practice questions to work through. This gave me the opportunity to practice in MySQL Workbench using sample data sets and questions, which helped improve my understanding.\n\nNote: After completing all the quizzes, I automatically had 44 out of 78 quizzes marked as completed in the Computer Science 303: Database Management course, which I plan to take next.\n\n**Assignment:**\n\nThere was one required assignment for this course, which I started around chapter 8 but finished before completing all the chapters. It took me about two days, though I could have completed it in one if I had started earlier. I found it helpful to look at GitHub, where some people had uploaded their completed assignments (I just searched \"Computer Science 204 Assignment Github\" on Google). While I used these as a guide for direction or troubleshooting, I made sure to do the work myself. Comparing my results with theirs (especially when they included query results) was helpful, although I was mindful that some could be incorrect.\n\nFor the assignment, some people chose to copy the data into Excel, save it as a .csv file, and then use the 'Table Data Import Wizard' to insert it into the database. However, since the assignment required demonstrating the insertion of data through queries, I opted to write Python scripts to format the raw data specifically for MySQL. I\u2019ve also created a text document with the table data already formatted for MySQL, which you can find [here](https:\/\/drive.google.com\/file\/d\/1iqN5t1HiubgSlO5IesydT2hRw2bwEw5-\/view?usp=sharing), though you will need to write the necessary queries to insert the data into your tables. Be sure to double-check the data, as it may have been updated in the course since I completed it.\n\nI received my graded assignment within a few hours. Although I initially lost 2 points due to an error in my query, I corrected and resubmitted it, receiving a score of 100\/100. Keep in mind that the assignment grade won\u2019t appear until the course and final exam are fully completed.\n\n**Final Exam:**\n\nOnce I finished all the chapters, quizzes, and the assignment, I took the course practice test twice, scoring around 90% each time. This made me feel ready for the final.\n\nWith a 100% on all the quizzes and 100% on the assignment, I only needed to score above 10% on the final to pass. The final exam was longer and harder than the course practice tests, but I ended up scoring 87%. However, there is a waiting period for the final score to be confirmed while they review the proctored footage for any issues.\n\nEdit: It took 1 day and my final was reviewed. Final course grade: 96% - Passed.\n\nGood luck!","permalink":"\/r\/WGU_CompSci\/comments\/1fqlv4f\/my_review_of_computer_science_204_database\/","created_utc":1727437922,"score":17,"text_length":5030,"vader_compound":0.9928,"course_code":"D427"}

Not a lot of this class was new info to me, just reminders and practice. \n\nHere's what I did:\n\nSep 16, Monday  \n0800-1000 : strategizing (via reddit), course planning tool, intro video (5 mins), zybook ch 1.  \n1030-1230 : zybook 2.1 - 2.14, call with PM.  \n1400-1600 : zybook 2.15 - 3.2 (didn't read everything, but did all the activities).\n\nSep 17, Tuesday  \n0800-1000 : zybook 3.3 - 3.16.1  \n1030-1230 : zybook 3.16.2 - 3.27  \n1400-1600 : zybook 4.1 - 4.11\n\nSep 18, Wednesday  \nNo school - I got my driver's license! If I start slacking on school this will be the reason, lol.\n\nSep 19, Thursday  \n0800-1000 : zybook 4.14 - 5.4  \n1030-1230 : zybook 5.5 - 5.16  \n1400-1600 : zybook 5.17 - 6.5\n\nSep 20, Friday  \n0800-1000 : zybook practice test  \n1030-1230 : PA - perfect, scheduled OA\n\nSep 21, Saturday  \n0800-1030 : review labs 6 and 9, OA.\n\nNotes: I got one question wrong. The one with Random. The pa uses integers, but the oa wants you to generate random doubles within a range. I recommend being able to do that, as I spent 30 minutes trying to logic my way around it with no success before finally giving up. The OA is very, very similar to the PA. At least it was for me.\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/x795mc7ou6qd1.png?width=1009&format=png&auto=webp&s=a09240a7162d3c1892d315c1e666ba4c6fb76f8c\n\n","permalink":"\/r\/WGU_CompSci\/comments\/1fm6tzj\/d286_java_fundamentals_passed\/","created_utc":1726935984,"score":27,"text_length":1384,"vader_compound":0.6646,"course_code":"D286"}

It took me 2 days, spending around 6-8 hours per day grinding on the course. I also did not take any notes.\n\nThis course has 12 Chapters and 87 Quizzes. I checked to see if there was a placement test for this course, but since there wasn\u2019t, I went ahead and started.\n\n**Quizzes:**\n\nFor each chapter, I would first go through the lesson by either reading or watching the video (in 2x speed), then take the quiz. My goal was to score 100% on every quiz. Each quiz usually consisted of usually 5 questions, and allowed 3 attempts. Interestingly, after completing some quizzes or lessons, quizzes in other chapters would sometimes be automatically marked as completed with a score of 5\/5. I also took the practice test for each chapter to review what I had learned.\n\n**Final Exam:**\n\nOnce I finished all the chapter lessons and quizzes, I took the course practice test twice, scoring in the 90s both times, which made me feel ready for the final.\n\nBecause I had achieved 100% on all the quizzes, I only needed to score 55% on the final to pass the course. The final was a bit longer and harder than the course practice tests, but despite that I ended up scoring 82%. However, there is still a wait time before the final score is confirmed, as they need to check the proctored footage for any possible cheating or other issues.\n\nEdit: It took 3\/4 days but my final was reviewed. Course grade: 88% - Passed.\n\nGood luck!","permalink":"\/r\/WGU_CompSci\/comments\/1fm1dlq\/my_review_of_computer_science_110_introduction_to\/","created_utc":1726919968,"score":13,"text_length":1616,"vader_compound":0.9108,"course_code":"D430"}

I like programing and am good at math (in that I'm good at making educated guesses, if I do say so myself). I have taken Calculus, Probability and Stats, Discrete Math 1, and now Discrete Math 2. If I never see another Extended Euclid's Algorithm, I'll be happy.\n\nOn a more serious note, this class was actually kind of fun. It was very applicable to programming and pretty straightforward in general. I will say that I did not expect such a good final score because I completely guessed on 4 questions and made educated guesses on several more.

{"post_id":"1f953tt","subreddit":"WGU_CompSci","title":"D427 - Data Management Applications. Passed in 12 hours + 30 min proctor delay","selftext":"Hi guys, I just passed Data Management - Applications today. I feel like I might have done better had my proctoring experience not dragged out so much, but then again, I normally take OA's in the morning and I decided not to wait this time around. \n\nI am 17 years old and now have 30% of my bachelor's done!\n\nThis class took me a total of 12 hours.   \nI followed the WGU study plan for the zybook (it skips a few sections)  \nHere's what I did - \n\nTuesday, Sep 3  \n0700-0900 : Course planning tool, zybook 1.1 - 1.11.  \n0930-1130 : zybook 1.12 - 2.7.  \n1300-1500 : zybook 2.8 - 2.14, 4.1 - 4.6.\n\nWednesday, Sep 4  \n0700-0900 : zybook 4.7 - 4.11, 5.4, 6.1 - 6.7, 7.1 - 7.2.  \n0930-1130 : zybook 7.3 - 7.9, 8.1 - 8.17(2x).  \n1300-1500 : PA (Exemplary), OA (Competent).\n\nThis one didn't take very long. The zybook is pretty much copy\/paste from Data Management Foundations, so if you just finished that, you can probably get away with just doing the unit 2, 7, and 8 labs. The labs and the PA are pretty much copy\/paste. The SQL parts of the OA are easy if you use the DESCRIBE tablename statement to make sure you got things right. There were a few SQL sublanguage questions (for example - which one of these is an example of the data manipulation language: drop, update, create, or something else).\n\nI had my first (relatively) bad proctoring experience. Didn't start the exam till 30 minutes after my scheduled time. Once I connected to the proctor, she said that my video and audio were delayed and she transferred me to tech support. But, that didn't connect, so (being the proactive person I am) I closed out of the app and restarted my laptop, banking on the fact that she had mentioned that I can reconnect within 30 minutes. Reconnecting, connected to a new proctor and, while the chat seemed a bit delayed, don't think it was enough for him to say something. But, he had me install the proctorU remote connection 'applet' in order to connect to my laptop and put in the exam code. I would have preferred not to install it so I asked him if he could just type the code in the chat for me to copy\/paste, or if he could spell it out over audio, but he said no, protocols. Anyway, finally connected to the exam. It was probably the most pleasant exam in terms of interesting content + no time crunch (they gave me like 4 hours).  \n\nThe monster (Discrete Math 2) is up next!\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/k8eawtw61vmd1.png?width=1009&format=png&auto=webp&s=8a74a602659731c9f580caaab13c06ec6e247791\n\n","permalink":"\/r\/WGU_CompSci\/comments\/1f953tt\/d427_data_management_applications_passed_in_12\/","created_utc":1725485200,"score":18,"text_length":2443,"vader_compound":0.9805,"course_code":"D427"}

Just a friendly reminder that this worked for me and might not work for you so just trust yourself with what you\u2019re using and how you\u2019re learning the material! \n\nTo begin the class, I opened zybooks then realized it would be challenging for me to learn this without having video context so I watched the Traversy YouTube videos about html and css. I liked the videos so much that I took advantage of our Udemy benefits and watched his tutorial series on Udemy for html and a little for css. Once I felt confident in what I knew, I went back to zybooks and everything sort of clicked! \n\nI went through all the html zybooks (except for the labs) the xml, and debugging. I made it about 65% through the css courses before I decided to wing the PA and failed (In hindsight, I should\u2019ve just watched the rest of the css Udemy videos and done the rest of the css zybooks).\n\nI looked at every single question on the failed PA (even the ones I got right) and really took my time in understanding what all the answers meant and if they\u2019d even be applicable to the question. \n\nI felt extremely confident in this and said screw it and took the OA and passed with an 84% (thanks Wgu grade viewer chrome extension!) \n\nHonestly, the OA was easier than the PA for me and there were questions on a little bit of everything, I recall debugging, xml, html tags, css styles, a few media and animation questions and a few PA questions were on the OA.

How common is it for you all to get evaluator feedback that doesn't match the rubric? I was working on D287(Java Frameworks), and one of the features is to create a Buy Now Button. The rubric **explicitly** states, \"The button should decrement the inventory of that product by\u00a0**one**. ***It should not affect the inventory of any of the associated parts.***\" \n\n\n\nThat being said, I just had my project returned for this, and the feedback for this part was, quote, \"A \u201cBuy Now\u201d button was competently added for each item in the products table, decrements the specific product inventory, does not decrement the inventory of associated parts when purchased, and displays purchase success and error status messages. **When the product inventory value is updated in the Product Update form, associated parts\u2019 inventory values are not decremented.**\"  \n\n\nAm I crazy, or is that the exact opposite of what the project's rubric says?

I now fully understand how hardware and software are related to each other.\n\nYesterday I was reading in C952 computer architecture, and I was thinking about all the different programming languages I've messed around with over all these years. I was kinda trippin out a little over the fact that the compilers largely turned all the code I wrote into the same handful of instructions, optimized it for me without me knowing, and all kinds of stuff. \n\nAnd then it clicked even more in two ways. \n\nFirst, I have an older computer I've been wanting to repair for many years and never got around to it. Today I made a note to turn it on cold, which will cause a blue screen and typically and error, \"driver irql not less or equal.\" I suspect the memory or the memory slot needs to be reflowed (solder melted to make a strong connection). But now I'm much more interested in analyzing the core dump to search for clues! \n\nAnyway, that's cool but a couple of years ago I discovered Nand Game. I highly recommend it, of course, but I had stored that information away with a new interest in how to create binary code with silicon, copper, electricity, and whatnot. I know for sure I built a 16-bit register, but I didn't finish creating everything nand game has to offer. Yesterday, for the first time, I was learning how the compiler, linker, assembler, dlls, machine code etc all work together to feed binary to the hardware. These tools dive down into the depths of this alien world, and not long ago I had randomly dug up from deep below and stopped. I just bridged the hardware and software completely. It's so satisfying! It feels like that Michaelangelo painting where God and Adam touch fingers. \n\nIf you sent me back in time to before computers, I could put a team together and with some trial and error I would likely succeed in creating one. I have all the ingredients, and this has given me a huge confidence boost toward future interviews.","permalink":"\/r\/WGU_CompSci\/comments\/1eyj2wg\/what_was_a_moment_it_clicked_for_you\/","created_utc":1724332625,"score":28,"text_length":2073,"vader_compound":0.9914,"course_code":"C952"}

The class is pretty easy and can be passed within a week. if you want to get through it I would recommend putting 2hrs of work in everyday for a week and you should pass it no problem. Took me a few weeks of very lazy on and off work which would I averaged 30min\/day.

I believe I got 5 questions wrong, you ONLY need to get a 65% or 26\/40 to pass, so you definitely don't need to stress for this class.\n\nThe way I got through this course is watching the value insight video series, doing practice tests and reviewing the official peoplecert Ebook for question and concept I didn't understand. This class is heavily focused on memory and concept comprehension and your main learning\/study tool will be grinding practice tests.\n\nI bought the ITIL 4 Foundation Exam prep app for the course and it's only 4$(link to the app is on step 3). It should be the only thing you drop money on, ***you Definitely don't need to buy any other resources***\\*.\\* I personally thought it was well worth it, the app included 9 quiz topics with questions ranging from 6-26 and 1 practice exam.\n\nThe only Jason Dion resource did I use was the study guide, it is very important you understand and visualize *the order of the four dimension* and the ***difference between service value chain(SVC) and service value system(SVS)***. The 1 page study guide can be found and downloaded from his Udemy course([JD udemy course](https:\/\/wgu.udemy.com\/course\/service-management-itil-4\/learn\/lecture\/16786414#overview)) or you can use this copy I found online ([JD Study guide copy](https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.studocu.com%2Fen-us%2Fdocument%2Fwestern-governors-university%2Fitil-foundations%2Fitil4studyguide%2F44970180&psig=AOvVaw1oPm1etH54niHSglRyWUc2&ust=1724005760890000&source=images&cd=vfe&opi=89978449&ved=0CBcQjhxqFwoTCNjur8PU_IcDFQAAAAAdAAAAABAQ)).\n\n**STEPS TO PASS:**\n\n* FIRST thing you need to do is request the exam ticket ASAP\n   * The ticket request can be found on your course page where you would schedule your Objective Assessment\n   * The instructor should accept your request within a day but sometimes it can take a few days so its important you do this before you even start studying\n   * Once your instructor approves it, they will email you a voucher to take the test on the peoplecert website and this is also where you'll access your EBOOK.\n   * Don't worry, you have a year after your request is approved to schedule the test before the voucher expires\n* SECOND step is to watch the value insight video series and take notes. ([Value Insight Video series](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/playlist?list=PLVzkjYR3xN1V9nlcECuygEZVlS4rj5qaf))\n   * Go through the whole video series while taking paper notes and creating your personal study guide (more helpful than digital notes and writing things down is a big boost to retention)\n   * I ended up having around 7 pages of notes by the end of the series\n   * I went thought the whole video series once and went back to a few videos for things I didn't understand, **its surprising how much info the VI short videos have regarding to the exam question**. its easy to underestimate the VI series since the videos are so short but Id say 80% of the info he provides shows up on the exam.\n   * This will help build your foundational knowledge on the material, it should take around 3hrs and you can complete this in one seating.\n* THIRD step was to start going through the practice Exams\n   * I went thought the whole ITIL 4 prep app until I was getting at least 75% on the short quizzes and practice exam.([ITIL4 quiz APP - IOS\/MAC](https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/itil-4-foundation-exam-prep\/id1507155404&ved=2ahUKEwj7zva-yPuHAxXsHUQIHSAWLgcQFnoECBgQAQ&usg=AOvVaw1pXOC6geifse9f2r6BVmi9)) ([Android version](https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details%3Fid%3Duk.co.zindiak.Quiz_ITIL4%26hl%3Den_US&ved=2ahUKEwj7zva-yPuHAxXsHUQIHSAWLgcQFnoECBIQAQ&usg=AOvVaw2jKlUxKp5hbF83Ix_2UMwA))\n   * I learned the a lot through these practice exams and the majority of my learning and memorization came from the topic quizzes.\n   * after I got through the prep app I went thought this practice Exam I found on a reddit post and the questions on here are the **most similar to the exam questions than any other**. (sorry I can't find the original reddit post) ([github practice exam](https:\/\/d12.github.io\/itil-quiz\/index.html))\n   * then I finally went through the last practice exam which was the cybervista exams.([Cybervista Exam](https:\/\/lrps.wgu.edu\/provision\/278239732))\n      * this exam is **the most useful resource I have used for this class** and I believe it should hold **priority** when studying for this class.\n      * This is due to the fact the question are a little harder compared to the exam, but they do have very relevant question that you will see on your exam and Cybervista does a really good job of explaining and citing the correct answer if you get a question wrong.\n   * after passing these exams with around a 75%, you will be ready for the Exam!!\n* FINAL STEP is going through the question and topics you don't know or keep getting wrong on your practice exams using the official ITIL 4 ebook ([EBOOK](https:\/\/ebook.peoplecert.org\/reader\/books\/9789925600496\/epubcfi\/6\/36[%3Bvnd.vst.idref%3Dgloss]!\/4)), **the great thing about cybervista is it tell you the correct answer and cites the exact chapters and pages for those topics on the Ebook** so you don't have to scrimmage and look for them. I have to say the Ebook is super comprehensive and well done, it's a great resource to use when there's a chapter, concept or definition you don't fully understand. After all that you are set and should easily pass.\n* Don't forget you have to make an account with [peoplecert](https:\/\/peoplecert.org\/login), then link your voucher code to it to get access to the exam and the EBOOK.\n\nCONCLUSION:\n\nThese steps can easily take you less than a week to complete if you put the work in. I didn't go through Jason Dion udemy course at all for this course, and I did not complete any of his 6 practice exams(in all honesty you don't need too either, its just extra work). The 3 practice exams I've linked plus all the materials I used are more than enough. This is my first reddit post and guide for a WGU course, I'm always going thought subreddits to find the best and optimal route for completing classes, now I feel its my time to make a contribution to everyone on the same boat. Hopefully this helps you and if you have a better method hope you can do the same for your peers in the future. GOOD LUCK, you don't need it!!\n\n  \nTL;DR\n\nstep 1- watch the videos once or twice, and memorize\/understand the one-page JD study guide.\n\nstep 2- Jump straight into the Cybervista prep exam and study what you dont understand using the Ebook until you can get 70% on it.\n\nstep 3- Go through the GitHub practice test before you take the actual exam.\n\nYOU DON'T NEED to pay for the quiz app;  it just a convenice tool that helped me learn the foundation a lot quicker. You Dont need to take the Jason Dion udemy course.","permalink":"\/r\/WGU_CompSci\/comments\/1eud6jy\/guide_for_wgubusiness_of_itapplications_d336\/","created_utc":1723884614,"score":41,"text_length":6108,"vader_compound":0.9992,"course_code":"D336"}

{"post_id":"1efvtt3","subreddit":"WGU_CompSci","title":"Help me understand something","selftext":"Hello everyone, first time Reddit post ever and just found the actual subreddit group. Sorry for the long post I\u2019m just looking for some insight amongst fellow peers.\n\nCurrently working on D387 - Advanced Java. \nI\u2019ve got a good amount done within my first year at WGU given my circumstances and knowledge level with computers\n\nI\u2019m on my second semester, coming to an end soon. First semester I got 9 classes done and for this one I\u2019m working on my fifth.\n\n For context I transferred as a prior computer engineering major so a lot of my credits weren\u2019t able to be applied at WGU for this degree (huge bummer) I think only 13 classes transferred and I was about 70ish percent done with the CE degree.\n\n but at least all the core and most math classes were able to transfer so I figured hey still a computer tech degree and it\u2019s at my own pace and hopefully I can progress quickly like all the YouTube videos promote for this school.\n\n- I don\u2019t work in the tech field yet.\n- no internships yet\n- work full time\n- I have a well paying job in the medical field to support my family (wife, young kids) so can\u2019t ditch it yet for a low paying internship \n- wife and I both in school\n\nI\u2019m trying to understand a few things pertaining to where I\u2019m at in the Computer Science world. I\u2019m over 60% done with the degree. And I\u2019m on my 3rd project class. I feel like I\u2019m missing something. Yes I know ZYBOOKS SUCK, all the WGU reddit posts guides from students are a godsend. I get it, this school is supposed to show how committed and disciplined you must be to self learn. But man has it been such a frustrating struggle & disappointment.\n\nHow am I this far in and still feel like I\u2019m barely grasping the basic concepts of computers and coding? I study my butt off and constantly research outside sources to get these classes done but there\u2019s SO MUCH. And man These project classes are the worst structured for a brand new student with no experience with coding outside of school. And honestly I don\u2019t know if I should just feel stupid for not understanding what they\u2019re asking me to do. Do they expect us to retain lines of code from several classes ago and apply it to the later courses without even a refresher. I don\u2019t know if everyone at WGU is just a computer genius lol but idk if and when I make it to the end and get the degree if I will have learned enough for a real world job. \n\nThe structure of the learning material is just bad. A lot of the instructor videos are terrible. I at least appreciate them trying and giving us more material outside of the zybooks but most of the videos are so vague for steps needed in these coding tasks. \n\nIm literally only passing them thanks to student guides and I feel that isn\u2019t right. I should be able to do it just off the class\u2019s material but it feels impossible for these performance assessment classes. Every time I pass one I hope the next one will be better but usually it\u2019s the same or worse. So am I just not built for this ? Is it normal ? Are you guys already experienced programmers in the field and coming back to get your degrees and that\u2019s why you make it sound easy? lol Cause it feels like they put my training wheels on in one class and then the next they put me on mountain bike and throw me down hill on the hardest bumpy trail possible. Insight and experiences appreciated I just want to know if I\u2019m the only one feeling lost this far in.

{"post_id":"1eb67qm","subreddit":"WGU_CompSci","title":"Finally Passing C952 Computer Architecture: My thoughts","selftext":"**Background:** Failed my first attempt!\n\n\\*\\*(you can skip this part and just read the advice if you do not care to know how I failed my first attempt)\\*\\*\n\n**First Attempt:**\n\n1. I was accelerating through my courses, and THEN I got to this course... I was completely burnt out by the time I started this one and after reading the first chapter, I was done. Took the PA, failed. I spent a few hours skimming the textbook, watched 3 of the Webinar videos on 1.5x, Assembly vid, computation, PA vid. Looking back, I should have put this course to the side and just worked on JAVA Fund. Anyways, didn't even try the PA again, just went ahead and SENT IT. Took the OA, and failed. I was really close to passing(honestly had to be A LOT of lucky guesses), the bar was close. This was the final nail in the coffin for me... I didn't touch the material for another 2 months and focused on ITIL 4\/JAVA.\n\n**Requirements to be approved for another attempt:**\n\n1. Instructor made me complete powerpoints for each section on the suggested review. Then I had to present them to 5 different instructor (45min apts each). I think he realized I completely ghosted this course and then tried to jump back in for another OA. So, I get why he required this. I seriously just copy and pasted most of this. I was extremely frustrated with myself at the time lol.\n\n**Second Attempt\/Advice:**\n\n1. After completing said requirements, I really began to dig into the book. Went from hating this course to absolutely loving studying Computer Architecture. The book is dry at points but some chapters are pretty interesting.\n   1. **Read the book (suggested chapters only)**\n      1. I read through all the chapters that were necessary according to the study guide.\n      2. I took my own notes for ONLY the blue highlighted vocabulary.\n   2. **Utilized Chatgpt**\n      1. Anything I couldn't grasp, I would copy and paste it into chatgpt and have it break it down in much more simpler terms. This made all the difference, not just memorizing vocab but understanding it, which is essential for the OA. (it's not just the vocab word then find correct definition 95% of the time on the OA).\n   3. **Watched the Lusby Videos**\n      1. I watched the lusby videos (75% of them) on 1.5x after reading the chapter\/taking notes to see if he pointed anything out that needed special attention. His videos are like a summary.\n   4. **Rewatched PA, Assembly, and Computation Videos**\n      1. Watched these on 1.5x, did skip around a little bit.\n   5. **20 page study-guide\/Computation worksheet\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\***\n      1. After a lot of digging, I was able to find these two docs on an old reddit post. These were amazing and really helped the most, imo.\n      2. Did a few computation problem sets. Used chatgpt to break it down even more for me.\n      3. [https:\/\/ashejim.github.io\/BSCS\/C952.html](https:\/\/ashejim.github.io\/BSCS\/C952.html)\n   6. **Quizlet**\n      1. Randomly throughout the day or in-between reading, I ran through some vocab on quizlet.\n   7. **Took PA again**:\n      1. Passed with ease!\n2. **Second OA: THESE OA's are very very high level! Don't get too deep into the weeds!**\n   1. Second OA was completely different than the first from what I remembered. only 2-3 computation problems on 2nd OA. (pipelining questions\/CPU Time are freebies if you know the equation).  I only had 1 history related question. (first OA had way more).\n   2. Around 60% was straight vocab, but having an understanding and not just memory is necessary, imo.\n   3. 4-5 Assembly questions. These are pretty straightforward. The participation activities really helped prep for these on the OA.\n   4. Few questions on Virtual Memory. Study that area and the surrounding content.\n   5. 1-2 Hit rate, hit time, miss rate, miss penalty questions. Vocab was key here.\n   6. Few memory hierarchy questions\/ TLB questions, Virtual memory, page table.\n   7. Know Caches and the different Schemes.\n      1. PASSED THE OA WITH A LOT OF ROOM TO SPARE!  FELT EXTREMELY CONFIDENT GOING. EVENTHOUGH THERE WERE SOME ODD BALL QUESTIONS.\n3. Vocab will get you by pretty far in this OA.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nI understand this is a pretty rigorous study plan. I completed all of this with hard study sessions, in 12 days.\n\n\\*\\*If you want to just get this class done asap, You may be able to get away with: Memorize quizlet vocab, watch Lusby, Vids on PA, comp, binary, assembly. Maybe do some practice problems, and take the PA to see where you are. \\*\\*\n\nThis may be too much for most people, but I went into the OA and was extremely confident. **I had two interviews for SWE internships shortly after completing this course, and because I knew this material so well, I was able to share about CA and use that to answer some interview questions\/go deeper into the questions regarding performance, cpu, memory, and a little history. They were very impressed.**\n\n**Overall, I came to love this course and so thankful I didn't just run through too fast,  just to pass the OA and move on. Those 12 days were long but worth it!**","permalink":"\/r\/WGU_CompSci\/comments\/1eb67qm\/finally_passing_c952_computer_architecture_my\/","created_utc":1721839589,"score":19,"text_length":4933,"vader_compound":0.9952,"course_code":"C952"}

Ideas for D326 Advanced Database Management Assessment","selftext":"Due to some issues getting tuition paid for this year, I was administratively withdrawn and lost access to this course's materials for a month while I made arrangements and appealed the withdrawal. A friend offered to help financially but he is very flaky and it took a while to get him to follow through, also I had to do an SAP appeal for financial aid (for next semester, and potentially for the current semester in case my friend ghosted me) which took a while.  For this reason I'm in crunch time trying to finish this PA. At most I have two weeks as long as I can get an extension due to the circumstances. My mentor says an extension is hard to get even with the fact that I was withdrawn for a month. I don't understand why but them's the breaks. \n\nTo make matters worse, the SAP agreement now applies to this current semester, meaning I'll lose aid for the next one if I don't get this done. If my friend hadn't dragged their feet, I wouldn't have been in this situation (I could've done the SAP appeal later and entered into that agreement at a better time, as I wouldn't have had to take aid for this semester). He eventually helped me out and I am eternally grateful, but I'm gonna have to fight like hell to stay in the game even now.\n\nD326 does not have a course chatter for me to get any inspo or guidance from other students. I'm just hoping someone has had experience with this class and can maybe point me toward a simple and effective idea for the project that isn't inordinately challenging. Any other wise or encouraging words are appreciated. I have an appointment with the instructor but I couldn't get one until this coming Sunday. \n\nI have some SQL experience and passed all the other DBMS classes with an exemplary rating. I'm confident that with some focus I can get it done, but I'll definitely need a little support until I can talk to the instructor. Please, please, please help a guy out, I'm so close to finally having my degree. \n\nTLDR; Tuition payment issues got me withdrawn, delaying my completion of this class, now I'm scrambling. Need the simplest approach to this project I can get, hoping it will guide where I go in the coursework. \n\n","permalink":"\/r\/WGU_CompSci\/comments\/1eangxj\/desperate_for_help_ideas_for_d326_advanced\/","created_utc":1721779913,"score":1,"text_length":2257,"vader_compound":0.9962,"course_code":"D326"}

But it was returned 3 hours after midnight last night. Everything functioned as it was supposed to, and I followed the Git\/README requirements and submission instructions to a tee. No idea why, and I guess I can't see it because the semester is over. \n\nI don't want to jump to conclusions and say the grading was wrong, but I have heard reports of submissions being returned despite everything being okay, and needing the CI to approve it being sent back as is because the evaluator was wrong. Idk, I guess it'll be easy to accelerate the course at the end of this term (assuming the PA doesn't change drastically or something lol).

{"post_id":"1dt4dbj","subreddit":"WGU_CompSci","title":"Final Project Setup Guide for No Lab Environment - D288","selftext":"This is a step-by-step guide for how to set up the D288 - Back-End Programming - Final Project so you don't need to use the Lab Environment. Using the Lab Environment is still a valid option, but this is for those who believe it is too slow and are willing to download some extra things on their PC.\n\n**Part 1: Transferring relevant files**\n\nFor this set, you must choose a method of transferring the data from the Lab Environment to your PC. I recommend using OneDrive with your WGU Email. \n\nFind the `LabFiles` folder in the C drive and upload everything in it other than the `D288 Front End` folder. Now create a new folder in the lab environment and copy over everything from the `D288 Front End` folder into it except the `.angular` and `node_modules` folders. Then upload this new folder. Next, download all the uploaded files to your local PC.\n\nWhen transferring the files, double-check that you are not transferring the `node_modules` and `.angular` folders. `node_modules` are javascript dependencies, and `.angular` are the build files created by the frontend. These folders are really large and should instead be created during `Part 2`.\n\n**Part 2: Setup Front-End**\n\nFirst, download NodeJs and NPM (they come together). There are plenty of YouTube tutorials on how to do this. [Heres One](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=__7eOCxJyow)\n\nThen open the folder created from `D288 Front End` in Part 1 in Powershell. Then run these commands in order.\n\n1. `npm i` (This will install dependencies)\n2. `npm run start` (This will run the start cmd in the `package.json` and start the front-end server)\n\nThe front-end application will be on http:\/\/localhost:4200\/. To stop the front-end, press `CTRL + C` in the PowerShell window. To start the front-end in the future, just run `npm run start` in the folder.\n\n**Part 3: Setup Back-End**\n\nFirst, install MySQL Server and WorkBench [Tutorial](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=u96rVINbAUI).\n\nAfter setting up Workbench and a local `MySQL80` server, follow the below steps to set up the database.\n\n* Open MySQL Workbench\n* Click on the 'Local instance MySQL80\\` connection.\n* Go to File > Open SQL Script\n* Find the `create_and_populate_db.sql` file and select it.\n* Click the lightning bolt to execute the script. (It won't work and will be grayed out if the server isn't currently running)\n\nYour database is now set up.\n\n**Part 4: Setup Project**\n\nInstall IntelliJ IDEA and use the `Lab Environment Set Up Instructions` file (below WGU instructions) to create and clone the repo to the local PC. Be sure to complete the `Lab Environment Set Up Instructions` on your PC rather than in the lab environment.\n\nAfter completing step 17 in the `Lab Environment Set Up Instructions`, press the `Load Maven Project` button that pops up.\n\nThen copy the contents of [`application.properties`](http:\/\/application.properties) in the LabFiles folder to the [`application.properties`](http:\/\/application.properties)  in the project.\n\nThen run the project. If it fails, press `File` -> `Invalidate Caches...` and restart IntelliJ IDEA. It should now work.","permalink":"\/r\/WGU_CompSci\/comments\/1dt4dbj\/final_project_setup_guide_for_no_lab_environment\/","created_utc":1719868681,"score":28,"text_length":2888,"vader_compound":0.8823,"course_code":"D288"}

This resulted in all my code being wiped clean from the pgAdmin database(even saving it on pgadmin didn't keep me from losing the code). **So please keep an eye on that timer! Be sure to save your code inside pgadmin and** ***a copy outside of it.*** **I believe you can keep requesting 30 more minutes at a time, when your run out of the 8 hours.** \n\n  \n***DAY 2:***\n\nWithout going into to detail with each required step, I will give a general outline of how i attacked this class.\n\n1. Business Problem:\n   1. Pick something really simple that will require the use of at least two tables. Such as payments\/ Store. This is probably the hardest part of the entire thing. \n2. **FAQ\/Common Mistakes Document:**\n   1. **This document was essential to a first round pass! I happened to come across it before submitting my PA and it saved my butt. I would have had some major corrections. So make sure to go through each common mistake for your entire PA.** \n3. Pre-Study:\n   1. To be transparent, I did finish the other two data courses before doing this one. I also practiced with DATACAMP and did the intro to SQL course. It helped me get through this one with very little struggle. Not much of a learning curve from SQL to postgre.\n4. Video:\n   1. The PA requirements are pretty vague. Thus, the need for the common mistake doc\/FA question. Also, t**here is a video, that will walk you through the PA requirements. It's an hour long but very much worth watching\\*\\*\\***\n5. Code: \n   1. Getting the trigger to fire correctly was a big challenge for me until I found this video:\n      1. [https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=l3rgdShkkfE](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=l3rgdShkkfE)\n   2. Transformation:\n      1. This was very easy, I chose to transform the cost per rental into an average (it helped with my proposed business problem). Don't overthink this one too. You can easily just concat strings. But make sure it's \"useful\" in some way.\n   3. Creating the tables (detailed, summary) was another super easy section to complete. \n   4. Checking Code:\n      1. For the code I made sure to \"--Check detailed table for xyz--\" to make sure in the video recording I was actually showing that the code was putting\/removing\/or refreshing the tables, and so on. So after, lets say, the \"create table summary\" after I put all my fields in then under the code I put comment --Confirm Summary Table-- The code: SELECT \\* FROM summary; to show it was actually created. \n6. Word Document:\n   1. I did this last (aside from writing the summary and business problem).\n   2. It was easier to do it AFTER all my code was done, so I can just fill in the word doc with exactly what was in my code. I'm glad I did this because I made changes throughout the code that would have forced me to change details on the word doc. \n   3. **Common mistakes doc is the key for this requirement and ensuring a first round pass. I put all the required details exactly like what I had in my code.**\n   4. **Code: I typed out my code at the end of the word doc as if I copy and pasted it from the pgadmin. Even my comments. Made sure there were no mistakes in my typed code.** \n   5. **MAKE sure to include the automated\/scheduler tool of your choosing! I did this under a comment in my code and in the word doc. I just explained tool I chose, what it did, and why I chose it.** \n   6. **SOURCES\\*\\*\\* I put down no sources used. Just be sure to put something. If sources were used then be sure to put that and cite them correctly.** \n7. Video Recording:\n   1. Not much to say here. I watched the given video on that is given through the link to the site at the end of the assignment requirements page. Then just went through my code and explained\/verified everything functioned correctly.\n   2. My video was 5 mins total. \n\nHOPE THIS HELPS! \n\n","permalink":"\/r\/WGU_CompSci\/comments\/1crzmif\/d326_advanced_data_management_passed_in_2\/","created_utc":1715712003,"score":9,"text_length":3830,"vader_compound":0.9958,"course_code":"D326"}
{"post_id":"1crcvvw","subreddit":"WGU_CompSci","title":"Passed D281 \/ Linux Essentials OA! ","selftext":"Got a 690, nice. \n\nPrior to this, my only real experience with Linux had been making a Raspberry Pi tablet that nobody really uses, and installing Kali Linux on a potato laptop. I'm a Mac user and I have used Terminal a bit, and I used DOS a lot in the 90s, so some of the material (particularly hardware, basic CLI) was familiar to me. I started studying about two and a half weeks ago. \n\nIn case this is helpful to anybody, this is what I did and here are my thoughts:\n\n* I went through the Cisco NetAcademy course. I did some of the labs. I read all the content and outlined it. It was *extremely* boring. \n   * I completed all the unit tests on the Cisco course (In one case, and chapter 9 I am looking at you, up to 11 times...) and looked up answers and reread material until I was consistently scoring 80% or, ideally, 90-100% on each unit, the midterm, the final, and the cumulative final. Last night I finally hit 80% on all except Chapter 18 (Special Directories and Files), which is sorta funny since I got 100% on the \"Security and File Permissions\" component of the exam. \n* I made Anki flashcards for everything I got wrong or that confused or even mildly interested me. Basically, I \"Ankified\" everything that was not a transition sentence, lol. \n* I also had a big document where I took notes from every single section. This was, honestly, mostly to keep myself from just skimming through and skipping over stuff because it was really *really* dull. It might not be efficient, but throughout my education (and this ain't my first school rodeo), I've found it useful to see how information is organized, so I generally make top-down outlines of what I read. I used to do this in MS Word but lately I've been using Notion since the formatting is nicer Maybe it's a total waste of time, because it took fivever. But I did it and now I have a huge Notion document of Linux notes....so I've got that going for me. \n* I went through the big blue Linux book. It was also EXTREMELY boring. It was actually sort of impressive, just how incredibly dull they managed to make that book.  After a certain point, it felt almost like meditation or a fever dream. I had a friend who did a silent meditation retreat and I think I started to feel like she described feeling towards the end of that.  I did as many of the exercises and \"explorational\" activities as possible (some required permissions that weren't possible with the VMs I had at the moment). \n* For a few days, I was using the online tests \/ flashcards that went with the LPI Linux Essentials Study Guide: Exam 010 v1.6 book, but apparently the site those were on was \"retired\" on April 30th, and it was annoying enough to get access the first time, so I didn't bother to try & figure out whatever it changed to.  I found that book to be the least helpful of the materials anyway. The practice tests were the best thing about that one. \n* I completed the Codecademy Bash scripting course one afternoon, since I like Codecademy's approach to scaffolding material and wanted to practice actually doing Bash scripting (but without, like, installing a VM).\n* I took all the Dion exams multiple times.\n* I followed the same process as with the Cisco exams, making cards \/ looking up anything and everything I got wrong. \n* I made Anki flashcards for all of the above, and used GIFs or made graphics or used ChatGPT \/ Midjourney to generate ridiculous \/ weird images or songs to help me remember commands. Please, let me regale you with my and ChatGPT's interpretation of Johnny Cash, called \"A Command Named Su.\" (And, actually, su came up ZERO times on the actual exam for some reason).\n* I played this \"[Command Line Murder Mystery](https:\/\/github.com\/makersacademy\/clmystery?tab=readme-ov-file)\" game and really wished there was more to it, because while it's a great intro to the CLI that I'd recommend to anybody new to it, it also replicated a lot of the stuff I was more familiar with. I would have loved it if there had been something like that for every corresponding unit of the Cisco course or chapter of the book.\n* I spent about a week and a half going through the flashcards during any and all downtime: During my kid's bath, on a flight, at a stoplight, at a family wedding, hair appointment, meals, whatever. \n* I had started out by downloading a public Anki deck that was supposed to be for Linux Essentials, but ultimately I didn't think those cards helped nearly as much as the ones I made myself. The process of making the cards is important, and the deck I found was all \"basic\" format (instead of Cloze or Image like I was using). The deck I found had very open-ended questions that lacked context, and I regret wasting time on it instead of just making my own cards from the get-go. In the end, my deck was 835 cards, though that included the rando one I had downloaded. I don't think I use Anki in the most efficient way, so that was probably too many.\n* I was able to attend one of the Cohorts and do the online game yesterday, and it was both fun and helpful. So I'd definitely recommend doing that. \n\nExam:\n\n* I was mildly surprised that there were a few more \"pick X of these options\" questions than I'd expected. I had thought there'd be 7; by my count, I had 9.  \n* In case you aren't aware, there are about 3 fill-in-the-blank questions on the exam. They only ask for one word, though. The practice exams do not have these types of questions. However, since I had no idea until yesterday that this was even a question type, I wanted to put that out there, since some people might get thrown off by a question type they're not expecting. \n* I did my exam at a testing center and it felt like a damn *vacation*. I managed to show up precisely on time for the first and probably only time in my entire life. It was, just extremely nice people, free parking, free locker for my stuff, a nice sunny window in the testing room, everything was very clean and bright. I wish I could take all the OAs that way!\n* I've taken the Dion and Cisco and Study Guide practice tests so many times they run together, so it's hard to say exactly which questions came from where, but I was surprised that a lot of the questions on the exam were *verbatim* from the pool of practice tests I'd been using. \n* In general, I think Dion's exams were a little bit easier than the actual exam and Cisco's were a little bit harder. Dion tends to have some goofy or humorous \"distracter\" wrong answer options (which, frankly, I appreciate because this was generally extremely boring material to me, sorry), but the other practice exams I took were all srsbiz. Also, since Cisco's unit tests are specialized to each topic, I think they go into greater depth than the actual exam might. \n* In the end, I think I did substantially better on the exam than I had on the Cisco material, so I'd say that Cisco over-prepares you a tiny bit and that's probably what you want, right? \n* I was so psyched about the \"Command Named Su\" and never even got to use it. :( \n\nRecommendations:\n\n* I am sure the best actual approach is to have and use Linux daily via the command line, or perhaps to be bo(u)rn(e) to a family fluent in C and grow up speaking Bash or C as your native language... but failing that, I'd start with the Cisco course ([Link](https:\/\/www.netacad.com\/)). It's fantastic that it's FREE. Note that about once a week they take it down for an annoyingly long maintenance window, but still. Each unit test is only 10 questions, and it doesn't actually tell you what the \"right\" answers are if you get them wrong, so it's extremely hard to get through a unit without having a good understanding of the material. \n* If you're not familiar with the CLI, definitely try the game I linked above. It's really cool. Actually, try it even if you are, it's just a fun way to practice. \n* If you can figure out where the practice tests went for the LPI Linux Essentials Study Guide: Exam 010 v.16 (by Bresnahan and Blum), they are fairly useful, but they are also very, very similar to the Cisco course. \n* It took me some time to figure out that the Dion course on Udemy is really *two* courses. One has videos and 2 practice exams, one is just 6 practice exams. Between the two courses, there are 8 practice exams. I took all of them multiple times and thought they were really good practice. I tried feeding the exams to Chat GPT and asking it to generate new questions, but it didn't work very well (they were too easy \/ just reworded, etc). \n* I love Anki, though I guess it might not work for everybody, and don't take a shortcut; make your own flashcards. \n* A lot of the material that seems to be floating around about this exam is redundant to the big boring book and the Cisco course. So I think it probably matters to just find a format you enjoy, or at least that you can stand (e.g., video, course, whatever) and stick with it all the way through. \n* The thing that helped the most for me, in terms of both trying to stay sane and memorizing the material, was trying to turn it into something fun and interesting. I actually began to enjoy the process of studying once I started making stupid \/ weird \/ traumatizing AI art images. I am sure a smarter person than myself (which is most of you) would've probably figured that out a lot faster. \n* The *real* kernel is the soul-crushing boredom we found along the way. Right? \n\nOK, onward and upward. Hope this helps somebody out.

{"post_id":"1ce4qdt","subreddit":"WGU_CompSci","title":"D287: Recommendations to learn Spring Boot?","selftext":"Hello everyone. If you've taken this class, you know that the Zybook uses the book \"Spring in Action\", which I tried following along with, but it uses a way older version of Java and Spring that are even available in the Spring Initializer tool (the book calls to use Java 11 but the earliest available version of Java is Java 17), and there are definitely some commands that flat out don't work anymore, such the @Controller annotation needed to just print \"Hello World\", which has now been replaced with @RestController, which I wouldn't have even known if I hadn't watched a video on Spring Boot before. \n\nWe all know that \"Hello World\" isn't even a tutorial-level project, it's more like a sanity test, and if this book couldnt even pass the sanity test then I highly doubt it's going to be a very reliable resource. Still, the biggest factor making me go back to it is that its basically one big guide for the Performance Assessment with it's Taco Cloud project. \n\nI tried following along with a tutorial by Dan Vega on FreeCodeCamp on YouTube, but this guy's using the GitHub AI assistant for most of everything so he barely explained how anything actually works. Devtiro's tutorial might be better to follow along to, but is there any other resource you would recommend that teaches you Spring Boot for this class??? I'd honestly prefer a book over a video series, so is there a more modern version of Spring in Action that I could follow along with?\n\nAny input is appreciated.

The longer one was more helpful than the shorter ones, along with [https:\/\/katrinars.notion.site\/Software-Engineering-b9d876e9c90041e9bfc416a1a7cd9bd8](https:\/\/katrinars.notion.site\/Software-Engineering-b9d876e9c90041e9bfc416a1a7cd9bd8)\n\n**A** - short 2-3 sentence introduction.

Include some specific goals and solutions and what this will achieve for the overall company.\n\n**A2** - a few bullet points and 2-3 paragraphs. Outline the problems (watch to the class resources for where to look) and highlight the major ones. Explain how the program will address these issues.\n\n**A3** - 4-5 bullet points with 2-3 sentences each. Look at the current problems and use the sections of the requirement document to guide you. Explain how your program will help these problems and achieve these goals\/objectives. Reiterate how this will help the company overall.\n\n**A4** - 3 rows in a table. You need at least 2 technical prerequisites, with dates (MM\/DD\/YYYY) of completion. Think about what goes into adopting new technology realistically, think on a physical and employee basis.\n\n**A5** - 2 paragraphs. Think about what the program is achieving and how. Everything within the requirement document is in scope. Things out of scope might be those prerequisites from above that are needed but not required to be installed\/implemented by the company offering the program.\n\n**A6** - 3 paragraphs. Mention operating systems, browsers, AND the additional information under the Hosting section in the requirement document. Follow the class resource walkthroughs for some ideas of SPECIFIC services\/programs you might use to implement the system. Think about hosting\/on-site, back-end, front-end, IDEs, languages. Make sure to answer the Hosting section!!\n\n**B** - one paragraph each. Pick four subheadings from the major headings. Summarize what\u2019s under the headings along with some application to the overall workings of the company.\n\nBusiness reqs - how these program improvements will help the success\/functionality of the company.\n\nUser reqs - how the user\/user basis will be impacted.\n\nFunctional reqs - what these requirements will do and how they work.\n\nNon-functional reqs - functionality on a broader scale. Not specifically how these things work, but how they should work - speed, usability, security.\n\n**C1** - Pick 2 and compare\/contrast.\n\n**C2** - Pick one and explain why it works for your program implementation. Explain why the other doesn\u2019t.\n\n**D** - A short intro followed by a paragraph for each visual. These visuals can pretty much be as in-depth as you would like.

{"post_id":"1c6uclw","subreddit":"WGU_CompSci","title":"Finally Passed Discrete Math II - C960 ... Dont give up, you will too!","selftext":"I wanted to write this post to encourage others who may not catch on as quickly with this class. I started this class in August of 2023 and I just passed last Sunday, April 14th, 2024 on my second attempt at this test. I know we frequently see post of those who can complete this class in a maximum of 3 months or less but just because you can't do that doesn't mean you won't pass or you can't get through this class. It took me 8 months to complete this class and yes it was a lot longer than I would like. I even thought this class would hold me back and possibly cause me to drop out but please if believe in yourself and work hard you can get through it. It may not be 3 weeks or a month but you will pass if you work hard at it. I have a few tips of my own from this class that I haven't seen here before:\n\nMore common tips already seen here:\n\nFollow the other tips you see where they encourage you to practice using the worksheets but the CI's also have Microsoft form available if you have already used the worksheets. In my opinion, the forms have similar difficulty levels to the OA, so go through these multiple times even going back and forth from the forms to the worksheets. If you are getting at least 70% on these and you don't need your notes to complete the questions you are probably good to take the test.\n\nThis brings me to another common tip to work with the CIs. I worked with all of the CI's but toward the last 3-4 months I was working specifically with John Hoffman and Nick Meyer. They are the best not to say the other CI's aren't because some of them were helpful with breaking down Big O and Recursive Algorithms. I like Nick and John because they were willing to just have a session where we would go over different types of practice questions together.\n\nFor everything you get wrong start thinking about why you got it wrong  and why the right way to do the problem or the right answer is correct. You can ask the CI's what you might be missing or misunderstanding.\n\nTake the PA and take the course planning tool a few days before the test and schedule with a CI to go over it. You get your answers back for the PA but with the course planning tool you don't get to see what you got wrong or right but the CI can pull it up. I say this because on my second time taking the test, there were at least half the questions from the course planning tool on my test but go over it with the CI so you can see what you got right and wrong and they can go over it with you for the correct answer. That way if you get that iteration of the test you do know the right answer or you know how to get the right answer.\n\nNew or Uncommon tips:\n\nI especially did this with probability and counting. Ask as many questions as you need to understand even ask if they can break it down simply and teach the concept to you as if you were in a classroom because you can't figure out what pieces aren't coming together this was also something I asked for. \n\nWith probability and counting. I was treating every type of probability and counting as different and thought I had to memorize every different type when some can be worked and treated the same way. Like dice, marbles, license plates, passwords, and coins all worked the same way. Card problems are worked differently. It was Nick Meyer who helped me realize that and made counting and probability so much easier. Probability can be worked like a counting problem in the numerator and the denominator is just the total number of outcomes. This helped me figure out what was the best way for me to learn some of the concepts and what I was doing wrong as I would explain my thought process back to them and what I\u2019m struggling with. \n\nTime management on the test is important which is why I wouldn't recommend taking the test until you can do the problems pretty quickly without having to think too much about it like looking at notes to remember. Understandably, that may not be the case with counting and probability but with the other units, you should be able to do that so can have a little extra time toward the end for those questions.\n\nDon't skip over the Expected Value or Baye's Theorem. Both times I took the test I had several Expected Values questions about 3-4 and they are pretty easy to understand just make sure you have a good amount of practice with it so you don't forget how to do it. I also had 2-3 Bayes Theorem on the second test and the first time I know I had more than 1.I didn't think I would get many expected value questions since it\u2019s a small chapter in the book and there was not a lot of emphasis on the worksheets or forms at the time. I know the CI's have added more of those problems to the forms and worksheets and they aren\u2019t that difficult to understand just make sure you know how to do them and practice enough so you remember how to do them. \n\nTry to take the test on a larger screen. I had a 13-inch laptop and I told my mentor it was hard trying to do the Automata questions because the formula sheet took up most space on the screen making the Automata smaller which made it hard to keep my place as I went through it. He said he thinks this happens on small screens and not if you are using a larger monitor. So I would suggest either going to a testing center or taking the test on a larger screen. The automata questions are easy points so you don't want something like that making you miss the right answer.\n\nI have anxiety and the first time I took the test I was anxious and worried I wouldn't pass. It was also a bad time for me a lot of other stressful and emotional things going on in my life at the time. Don't let test anxiety get to you either. It got to me the first time. Take the test when you feel confident. Keep telling yourself you are going to pass. Speak it into existence. Make sure you're in a good headspace. As a woman, I also watched Hidden Figures the night before. It was a confidence booster and inspiring. I went for a walk to get oxygen to my brain and get my blood pumping. I also had a bite to eat and took a nice shower to relax.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI hope this helps and Good Luck!","permalink":"\/r\/WGU_CompSci\/comments\/1c6uclw\/finally_passed_discrete_math_ii_c960_dont_give_up\/","created_utc":1713413803,"score":24,"text_length":6186,"vader_compound":0.9955,"course_code":"C960"}

I knocked it out in \\~1 day, spending most of my time grinding on the course. I was debating on just doing the Natural Science Lab at WGU, but I'm glad I chose otherwise.\n\nThis course had a total of 11 interactive lab activities, and 2 touchstones.\n\nThis class was actually pretty fun. I'm not the best at biology, but the activities felt like playing a video game and answering questions throughout. If I absolutely needed help on a question in an activity, I would screenshot the question, feed the image into an image to text converter, and search for some guidance.\n\nYou can pause and resume the activities at any time (it saves your place), and go back to certain steps in each simulation in the mission tab if you got points off on a question. I aimed at getting 100% or as close to that on every activity so that passing the course would be easier.\n\nThe two touchstones for this course were both based on a single activity right before them. I would recommend working on each touchstone and doing the activity at the same time (filling out the touchstone while progressing in the activity). Because I did this, I didn't need to constantly go back throughout the activities and repeat everything multiple times.\n\nWhat I liked about this course was that you could still progress in the course while a touchstone was submitted and waiting to be graded. I was able to submit the first touchstone, then work and submit the second, and continue until I completed the rest of the activities for the course.\n\nFor the first touchstone (Touchstone 4) I got a 232\/250. I got points off for not framing a solid hypothesis in the first part, and points off for not providing a detailed summary for each of the steps in the simulation and not mentioning the equipment used.\n\nI received a 250\/250 on the second touchstone (Touchstone 5), and ended with an 98% overall in the course.\n\nHere is a link to both my touchstones as a guide for those who need it:\n\n[https:\/\/drive.google.com\/drive\/folders\/1DR\\_bRaBy8pfo9wBI9o6RuT2jNUY8nBKO?usp=sharing](https:\/\/drive.google.com\/drive\/folders\/1DR_bRaBy8pfo9wBI9o6RuT2jNUY8nBKO?usp=sharing)\n\nGood luck!","permalink":"\/r\/WGU_CompSci\/comments\/1c18tmc\/my_review_of_human_biology_lab_scie1021_at_sophia\/","created_utc":1712819460,"score":48,"text_length":2116,"vader_compound":0.9927,"course_code":"C683"}

It seemed to be geared toward people who want to go into the networking field, so definitely not me.\n\nFor the final touchstone, you have to set up an IT network for a fictional company and write a report on your recommendations. They provide a sample which was very helpful for when I didn't know what to do. The touchstone is required to be 2000 words or more, so it might take some time.\n\nI would strongly recommend downloading the final touchstone at the beginning and working on it while progressing in the course. The touchstone is set up to ask questions pertaining to the units in order, so I filled it out periodically. I also downloaded the touchstone tasks to use as extra support when I didn't know what to write.\n\nOverall, I received a 160\/160 on the touchstone and a 95% in the course.\n\nHere is a link to my touchstone as a guide for those who need it:\n\n[https:\/\/drive.google.com\/drive\/folders\/1gSGiTXHjBNtWhP0Tn1\\_8xR7EQy78QdaG?usp=sharing](https:\/\/drive.google.com\/drive\/folders\/1gSGiTXHjBNtWhP0Tn1_8xR7EQy78QdaG?usp=sharing)\n\nGood Luck!","permalink":"\/r\/WGU_CompSci\/comments\/1c1a5q2\/my_review_of_introduction_to_networking_cs1015_at\/","created_utc":1712825002,"score":20,"text_length":1532,"vader_compound":0.9745,"course_code":"D315"}

No revisions needed, passed on first attempt. \n\nMy background: ZERO experience with Git\/GitLab.\n\n* What I did: \n   * I started by watching programming with Mosh: \"Git tutorial for Beginners: Learn Git in 1 hour.\" Just to get familiar with the BASIC terms and operations. \n   * I started to watch the LinkedIn learning videos provided by the course (if you are really struggling these will walk you through step by step). My ADHD would not allow me to sit for so long without doing anything. I learn best by doing!\n   *  I then read the Rubric VERY carefully to understand exactly what they wanted. \n   * Next, I started at A and just began trying! I used my MAC terminal paired with VSCode. VSCode made things so much easier. Especially when it came to merge conflict & resolution.\n   * The A-F requirements are so vague and scrambled that I had to walk away a few times to gather myself, it was really frustrating. However, I took screenshots and labeled each one with the description of exactly what they wanted to see. (I used Preview to put all the screenshots into one pdf file and then pushed that.). \n   * GOOGLE: google and youtube are your friends when it comes to this PA. Use the Git cheat sheet to see the terms and what exactly they do. If you can't figure something out, GOOGLE it! \n* Conclusions: All in all, the instructions for this course are the worst part. However, just give exactly the screenshots they ask for, nothing more\/nothing less. Don't overthink this one. I had many times throughout the day where my solution was right in front of my face but walking away and coming back to try again let me see more clearly.

After using all of the incredibly helpful guides on here for this course. I had been stuck at D on the PA, I could not for the life of me get the Controllers to work where I could link my mainscreen page to the about page. I started using a workaround to move on to E, and then realized I would need to resolve my original issue.\n\nI finally chose to meet with the instructor and he was able to quickly point out some issues, I never would have found myself. Essentially, my localhost:8080 was not working, but somehow I was able to still access the website of my shop by using localhost:63342. After meeting with the instructor, he took me to the application.properties and we renamed my database. Something he pointed out I would have done at step G. When I asked if localhost was not supposed to work til then, he said no, should have worked the whole time. It makes no sense.\n\nIf you are struggling, just reach out to an instructor.

Or different?\n2. During the test, are you able to reference anything at all? Or is it the same as most where you have a proctor watching and can't open any other tabs?

Espescially java because it's got a lot of boilerplate code like public\/private\/static\/system.out\/etc which I don't always remember the exact format.

{"post_id":"1ayjlet","subreddit":"WGU_CompSci","title":"C960 Discrete Math 2 passed in 2 weeks. Here are some tips I learned along the way.","selftext":"Alright I am writing this not necessarily as a guide but as a general tips I gathered and things I would've done differently.\n\n\n\nThe best advice I can offer for excelling in Discrete Math is to thoroughly understand the counting techniques and know precisely when to apply them. Additionally, it's crucial to book time with the Course Instructors (CIs). I personally scheduled at least two appointments every day, allowing them to walk me through problems while I observed and asked questions. One strategy I wish I had implemented was using a screen recording tool, like OBS, to record the Webex meetings with my instructors. This would have allowed me to revisit the explanation later. Although they send you notes afterwards, there are times when you might still be puzzled about how they arrived at a certain solution.\n\nMoreover, when you have an appointment with a CI, it's beneficial to prepare in advance by selecting the questions you're struggling with. Note the chapter, section, and question numbers to help your CI quickly find and address your concerns. They can then immediately start solving the problem on screen. Typically, they manage to get through 2-3 questions, sometimes more, depending on the topic.\n\nAnother tactic I found helpful was to immediately open the relevant zyBook section and search YouTube for videos explaining that topic. Watching a video before tackling the practice questions helped reinforce my understanding. There are numerous YouTube playlists tailored to these guides, so saving these playlists and reviewing the questions while watching the videos can be incredibly effective.\n\nAs for navigating the course, avoid getting bogged down in any single unit, such as Unit 3. If you're struggling, it's better to move on and complete other sections first. You can always return to tackle the more challenging topics, like Recursion and Induction, later on. Remember, counting techniques are a significant component of the OA, so it's vital to engage in extensive practice.\n\nDon't underestimate the value of a good calculator; I used a Ti-nspire cx non-cas, which was immensely helpful. Lastly, it's important not to feel discouraged if you're taking longer than two weeks to finish the course. I took a two-week break from work and dedicated at least 12 hours each day to working through zyBooks, completing every single practice problem and revisiting worksheets repeatedly until I could consistently solve the problems correctly.\n\nMath requires both time and practice. I realized that the only way to truly grasp the material was to work through problems repeatedly. If you're ever stuck or have questions, keep in mind that the material is still fresh in my mind, as I passed the class on February 15th.","permalink":"\/r\/WGU_CompSci\/comments\/1ayjlet\/c960_discrete_math_2_passed_in_2_weeks_here_are\/","created_utc":1708742833,"score":27,"text_length":2839,"vader_compound":0.995,"course_code":"C960"}

Then I was consistently at a loss because it seemed like their examples were getting exponentially more difficult and it was incredibly hard to follow what was happening.\n\nI came across a YouTube channel \"The Pursuit of Happiness\" who happened to create a playlist of videos that coincide pretty well with the textbook. I searched \"WGU Discrete Math 2 Unit x\" with x being units 1 - 5. It's a compilation of several different prominent YouTube creators for Discrete math, including TrevTutor, Kimberly Brehm, and Trefor Bazett. \n\nI highly recommend using the videos to go through each unit and then going back to the zybooks and completing the questions there. I honestly should have done better on counting techniques but Baye's theorem doesn't agree with me unless I can create a tree to model the problem and there were a few problems in the exam that I was unable to do so with easily...\n\nDiscrete 2 was definitely the hardest of the math courses offered so far because they really make sure you know what you're doing. Your calculator can not help carry you through this course and a lot of the problems are either you know the steps on how to do it or you don't.\n\nIn my opinion, the majority of the formula sheet is fairly useless because if you need to reference it, then chances are you're not comfortable enough with the material. This is a class where there's really no wasted material. Everything you see in the book is pretty much on this exam.\n\n* You NEED to be able to do Euclidian for GCD and extend Euclidian\n* You NEED to be able to do the multiplicative inverse (which is just extended Euc. algo)\n* You NEED to be able to convert to binary, hexadecimal, and back\n* You NEED to be comfortable with recursion represented via pseudocode\n* You NEED to be able to do modular exponentiation and fast exponentiation\n* You NEED to be able to do induction ALL THE WAY THROUGH\n* You NEED to be able to work through the entire RSA algorithm to get d (just like in the practice exam)\n* You HAVE to be comfortable with both permutations AND combinations\n* You NEED to understand Baye's theorem\n\nThe YouTube series will get you most of the way there on a lot of these topics, but you really have to attempt the problems on your own after they've done their example to show you the steps.

So! Basic gist is, I've got most of my app working; the customers table is populated, the order tracking number is showing, aaaand\u2026almost nothing else. I have images, I can add things to my cart and checkout, but it just doesn't actually work because no data is being passed. The price field of the vacations is blank, customer information is blank\u2026and the only errors being thrown is in the console for the main.ts and numbers are being passed as NaN. It's hard to describe, I haven't found anyone asking a question about this so far, just the order tracking number issues.\n\nExample, \/customers: The customers table is populated correctly with all fields filled (John Doe + 5 tests). The page has six blank boxes with no info in them. My console is throwing several errors relating to the main.ts and core.mjs. There are no errors in IntelliJ.\n\nAnd it basically does that for every page. The only thing I can get to show is the order tracking number at the checkout purchase page, which required me to disable saving cart, cartItems, and customer (all three, I checked) to their repositories, so I'm pretty sure that's also not actually working and I've well and truly messed up somewhere. None of the other tables populate at any point, but it's not throwing any other errors, so I don't know where in my code I need to be looking. Nothing stands out to me.\n\nCould this be just a mapping issue and I should redo all of my entities? That was my first thought, but they all look accurate to the examples in material and other students that have had mapping issues.

To preface, this degree is my first time being introduced to these topics, but if I followed this guide from the start, I would have done it faster than the week it took me.\n\nThe biggest tip is that I didn't focus on the coding aspect of the algorithms at all. That's what I went in trying to do and it just confused me because I didn't understand the steps of the algorithms just yet.

{"post_id":"1aebq62","subreddit":"WGU_CompSci","title":"Passed D281 - Linux Foundations","selftext":"Hey all,\n\nWanted to share what worked and what DIDN'T work for this class. First of all, if you're going to take the exam at a location, make sure you leave your home WAY earlier than you think you'll need to. I got stuck in traffic for two hours, missing my exam and losing the voucher. Meaning, I had to pay $120 to get my own. Anyways..\n\nIf you're taking the exam through OnVue, the process is actually more laid back than Examity. It took about 15 minutes to take pictures and andother 20 to get connected to a proctor, but I took it at 4:45 PM, so YMMV. \n\nFirstly, disregard the provided book for this class. I don't understand why they went with it when LPI offers their materials for free, but whatever. I went through the book and found it to be too basic in the way it asks questions and it has some outdated info, along with fluff that you don't need. The actual exam is harder than the questions the book asks.\n\nThe first resource you should use is the official LPI handbook:\n\n[https:\/\/learning.lpi.org\/en\/learning-materials\/010-160\/](https:\/\/learning.lpi.org\/en\/learning-materials\/010-160\/)\n\nRead through it, understand it, do the practice questions. The lab that WGU has provided is not only slow, but it uses an enterprise version of Linux that lacks a lot of the features, and it logs you in as ROOT user, which is something that shouldn't happen. The easiest way to do the practice is to set up your own environment, and here is a little guide that tells you just how to do that:\n\n[https:\/\/ubuntu.com\/tutorials\/how-to-run-ubuntu-desktop-on-a-virtual-machine-using-virtualbox#1-overview](https:\/\/ubuntu.com\/tutorials\/how-to-run-ubuntu-desktop-on-a-virtual-machine-using-virtualbox#1-overview)\n\nI liked Ubuntu so much that I actually installed a partition on my SSD that I now use. It turns out I actually like Linux quite a bit, even though this was my first time using it. \n\nAfter you have read the official LPI book (it isn't that long) and have done the practice problems, you will need to test yourself. For that, you can use the following two resources:\n\n[https:\/\/wgu.udemy.com\/course\/linux-essentials-practice-exams\/learn\/quiz\/4734534\/results?expanded=1173925680#overview](https:\/\/wgu.udemy.com\/course\/linux-essentials-practice-exams\/learn\/quiz\/4734534\/results?expanded=1173925680#overview)  \\- The six practice exams by Jason Dion. They are a bit easier than the actual exam, so I'm not quite sure they will be enough to pass. \n\n[https:\/\/www.netacad.com\/courses\/os-it\/ndg-linux-essentials](https:\/\/www.netacad.com\/courses\/os-it\/ndg-linux-essentials) \\- Use the Module quizzes as well as the midterm and final exams to gauge your knowledge. These are VERY close to how the exam will ask questions. If you can consistently get about 80% on both Jason's tests and these, you are probably ready. \n\nFinally, go through Sawn Powers' youtube series for a refresher:\n\n[https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=skTShEHyXfo&list=PL78ppT-\\_wOmvlYSfyiLvkrsZTdQJ7A24L](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=skTShEHyXfo&list=PL78ppT-_wOmvlYSfyiLvkrsZTdQJ7A24L)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter all of that, the one last thing that I did was go through the LPI material and write out every command and its options on a 'cheat sheet' and review it a few times before the exam. I got 690\/800, doing about an hour a day of studying for a week and a half.

{"post_id":"1adhho2","subreddit":"WGU_CompSci","title":"Passed C960, Discrete Math II","selftext":"Hey all,\n\nJust took the DM2 exam. Got a pretty high score. It took me about two weeks of working 1-2 hours per day on it. Here's what I did:\n\nUnit I\n\n* If you've taken any programming classes, you probably know how to read pseudocode, so most of the unit you can skip. Look at the practice problem set for O, Phi and Theta notations.  The text never really makes it clear how to do those problems, but for example in problem 11, what is actually being asked is does the equation in the parentheses of the answer (e.g.   \u03a9(xlogx)) represent the worst case bound (i.e. does it bound from above), best case bound from below, or a tight bound. \n* Know how to analyze the big-O of an algorithm. You'll need to know it for several problems.\n\nUnit II\n\n* Follow the practice problems closely on this. You will likely see every type of practice problem provided on the exam, and you are not likely to see anything that is not covered by the practice problems. You should know this unit very well.\n\nUnit III\n\n* Induction on the exam is a bit more difficult than what the practice problems offer. I would say that the induction problems are more similar to what you would find in the book. I would say that if you can do the activity problems in 3.9-3.12, you should be ready for this part of the exam.\n* Recursion is fairly similar to what is on the practice problems. Know how to analyze recursive calls using a table rather than drawing a tree. It will save you a lot of time.\n* Summations: If you have a Casio fx-991EX Classwiz (one of the recommended calculators), look up how to do sequences and series on it. You will thank me for it. If you don't have the calc, go buy one. It's cheap.\n\nUnit IV and V\n\n* These two go hand in hand. They are probably the BIGGEST part of the exam. Practice problems provided by the class are VERY close to what you might see on the actual exam. Know how to do each one of those, know why you're doing it. Most of the questions were Unit 5, but I think there is at least one question belonging to each module in both Units. The formula sheet will only get you part of the way there. \n\nUnit V\n\n* This is a super easy Unit. Go over this and just understand what's happening, and you'll get some REALLY easy points on the exam. \n\nIf there is one piece of advice I can re-iterate, it would be to DO THE PROVIDED PRACTICE PROBLEMS and UNDERSTAND them. Also, get a Casio fx-991EX Classwiz. \n\n&#x200B;","permalink":"\/r\/WGU_CompSci\/comments\/1adhho2\/passed_c960_discrete_math_ii\/","created_utc":1706487197,"score":47,"text_length":2448,"vader_compound":-0.4729,"course_code":"C960"}

{"post_id":"19ea573","subreddit":"WGU_CompSci","title":"D333 Ethics In Technology: Passed: 10 hours","selftext":"Start off by saying, I absolutely hated this course! \n\nI completed this course over two days.\nTime to complete: 10 hours (not including speechify listening time, I\u2019ll explain).\n\nWhat I did: \n\nDay 1: Read through the entire document \u201cSummary of chapters.\u201d I preferred using the summary document rather than clicking through the e-book. Then for each chapter, I read the key terms. Finally, I copied and pasted the entire summary document into speechify and listened to it on 1.5x throughout the day. (I signed up for a free 3 day trial). Then watched the AI bias video from YouTube (10min one) and the 30 minute one on pluralsight. Copied the the video transcript and used speechify on 1.2x for it. 4 hours total of focused study not including speechify. \n\nDay 2: Took the PA first thing in the morning. Failed it, right around 65%. (I did not look at the questions I got wrong). Focused in on the coaching report and areas for suggested study. Watched the provided videos in course material on consequentialism, Deontology, Utilitarianism, Virtue ethics (the videos from YouTube playlist and the ones given by the CI). Partially filled out the study guide (only areas I was struggling with according to the PA). Used Quizlet to study the laws (think it\u2019s a 40 card set). Quickly ran through the 300+ term quizlet set. Took PA again in the evening. Easily passed this time and made sure to look at all the questions and any I got wrong.  Schedule the OA for the evening. Decided to take a break and let my mind relax a little before the OA. This day was around 6 hours of focused study (again not including speechify) before taking the OA. \n\nThe OA: without giving specifics to exact questions (the OA is still pretty fresh in my mind). This is what I encountered the most. High overview of MY OA. No particular order. \n\n1) Know AI Bias!! The AI article and the pluralsight video is extremely important! \n\n  b) Laws, Laws, and more laws. The quizlet \/chapter summaries pretty much prepared me to get through those questions. \n\n2) Know consequentialism, Deontology, Utilitarianism, Virtue ethics, relativism . The PA really helped me understand how these apply! Very similar questions on OA with these. These are super easy once you know the basics definitions and look at the PA. \n\n3) IT security had at LEAST 4 questions. CIA triad, types of attacks. \n\n4) Know what\u2019s ethical\/unethical and legal\/illegal. Again, the PA was extremely helpful on familiarizing the type of questions you will encounter with these. Take your time!!! Read and reread the questions carefully! \n\n5) software engineering code of ethics! This one got me. I was not expecting so many questions on this topic. Definitely had to guess on a few. \n\n6) Privacy: laws, applications \/ intellectual property. \n\n7) ethical decisions in SD was another chunk of questions. \n\nConclusion: The OA was definitely more challenging than the PA. So make sure you can get through the PA comfortably. I found the PA to be very helpful in preparing for the OA. Overall, this class was annoying to say the least. It was a mix of straight rogue memory of terms and \u201ccorrect or more correct\u201d type of questions. Again, you can easily eliminate two right off the bat then read the question carefully again. I passed scoring exemplary in 2 of the 4 sections. Hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.

{"post_id":"19dag3p","subreddit":"WGU_CompSci","title":"D276 - Web Development Foundations Pass\/Review","selftext":"Hey guys. I just got out of my OA session, and feel the writeups on this class have been very very misleading. Probably becasue most of them are old, and possibly the test has been updated. This class took me 29 hours, or about 2 weeks IRL time. I thought it was super simple. I have no previous experience in HTML or CSS. This is what I did:\n\nFirst: I did what every normal person does, and researched reddit on the best way to pass this class. I found traversys videos on [CSS](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=yfoY53QXEnI&ab_channel=TraversyMedia) and [HTML.](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=UB1O30fR-EE&t=2751s&ab_channel=TraversyMedia) I watched both of those first and disregarded the course material (for now). This was a great choice, as he explains alot. You can follow along, but I just watched and took notes. If you watch these videos first, and have taken Intro to IT don\u2019t see an issue completely skipping Chapter 1. After that I would work through it, even if you think you know the content. Only because it\u2019s valuable practice for someone with little to no experience. I did a lot of not fully reading the content, but did all of the participation activities on chapters 2-6.\n\nSecond: I took the PA, and as expected I failed. Nothing more here.. moving on.\n\nThird: I did the course material (I skipped units 7 and 1) which helped tremendously. I was very glad that I watched traversys videos first, as most of this felt like review. This enhanced the learning for me as I was able to work ahead and get the ZyLabs done quick. Alot of the content nowadays in the material is instructor created. Of course you do still have some of the bland ZyBooks content, but it was all good stuff and reflected the OA well. It is not what I expected reading other posts. I genuinely enjoyed working through this class. After I completed each section including the labs, I took the quizzes quiz on it. I generally got around a 70-90% on the quizzes. Typically in the 80s. This can be found in the announcements section of the course, and is another fantastic instructor created material. I never spoke with him, but the instructor seems very passionate about the material.\n\nFourth: After all of that, I retook the PA and passed (barely). After this I reviewed what I did not understand from it, and took a few OA simulations on quizzes. I probably only spent 4-5 hours max reviewing the course content after the PA retake. On a whim I scheduled the OA and knocked it out of the park. The OA was very suprisingly simple. Unlike what I had read before, the OA was nowhere near as hard as I thought it would be. Just use common sense, and read the problems. I scored higher on the OA than I did any of my simulations, and any of the PAs I took.\n\nOverall: This class isnt near as hard as reddit made it seem (at least to me). This class should be fun. I had alot of fun creating websites about random things for practice.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;","permalink":"\/r\/WGU_CompSci\/comments\/19dag3p\/d276_web_development_foundations_passreview\/","created_utc":1705967720,"score":29,"text_length":2832,"vader_compound":0.9929,"course_code":"D276"}

{"post_id":"1jfw1w1","subreddit":"WGU_MBA","title":"Hate ProctorU, but passed C214","selftext":"At this point, I feel like I have to build time into my day to expect ProctorU to have issues when I am taking an exam. My OA for C214 was scheduled for 4:40 p.m. yesterday. I didnt finally get into the exam until about 7:45 after being passed around to technician to technician. I finished around 9:30. So basically it was a FIVE HOUR testing experience. In the midst of it all, \n\nI wrote a really emotional email to my mentor telling him how frustrating this is on top of normal testing anxiety. He said they had to switch to a more robust platform because there was a lot of cheating with the last one. I guess some dude took 20 people's OA for them? I feel like both things can be true though. They can have a need for a robust platform, and not keep using one that is causing so many issues for people. It is exhausting. I work full time, and dont have time for a half day testing experience. \n\nANYWAY, onto C214. It wasn't harder than the PA persay, but I found the questions to be a little more convoluted. Really read through the question multiple times to really make sure you are understanding what they are asking. A lot of the questions can be answered if you look at the formulas page and see what certain ones are indicating. \n\nI've seen a lot of people here say you dont need to focus that hard on the math, but I feel like this is an area where you can easily get 100% on if you know the excel inputs. If you do the chapter quizzes for the TVM, Bond, and NPV\/IRR sections, they will give you a lot of practice for doing them for the exams in excel. \n\nTbh, I tried to just watch the videos at first, but it was not clicking. Also, not everything is covered in the videos that will be on the OA. Going through the book material was super helpful for me, but time consuming. What I would do to make it more easy to understand is copy and paste each section into ChatGPT and tell it to make the section more simple and easy to understand. I did this for the whole dang book, and it was so helpful. I made sure to take all of the quizzes too. \n\nI then went through and watched the accelerated videos, which only takes a few hours. \n\nAfter that, I went over the interactive concept quiz until I could do it and get 100%. \n\nI do suggest making sure you understand SEC, SOX, FINRA, statement of cash flows, FCFE, the strengths and weaknesses of CAPM and the Gordon Growth Model, common stock and preferred stock, diversification. The indirect method is most commonly used for statement of cash flows. Be able to identify what are current assets and liabilities in order to do a calculation. \n\nBut really for everything, read the question fully! You might be subtracting years, multiplying, dividing, etc based off the clues they give you!

Tips","selftext":"Going into this class, I was really anxious after reading the Reddit posts hearing how long it took them or difficult it was. Thankfully, I didn\u2019t have the same experience. It took me three days in total to do this class with no prior experience in economics or business. You can probably do it even shorter since watching all the lectures takes 4.5 hours which I split into two days and the review will take a few more hours depending on if u fill the study guide yourself or not. \n\nTips:\n* (Day 1 and 2)The cohort videos for competency 3 and 4 are extremely useful and will tell you everything you need for know for the OA. Skip the ones with Dr. Behroz Baraghoshi and just read the slides instead. This will take \n* (Day 3) Used the study guide to fill in the gaps for competencies 1, 2, 5\n* (Day 3) DO THE END OF CHAPTER QUIZZES!!! Specifically the Pre-OA review tests for all competencies which just combines everything. It was THE MOST USEFUL, most similar to OA and has the same type of wording. I even saw the same questions from those quizzes in the OA. (I skipped competencies 3 and 4 and you can see how I did worse) \n\nMajority of things in my OA:\n* Institution based view and all about that \n* Three types of globalization \n* OLI specifically about location \n* Free market view \n* Disadvantages for home country \n* All about collusion \n* All about 4 strategies to fight MNEs (dodger, contender, defender, extender) \n* how inflation and interest affects exchange rate \n* Currency hedging \n* All about type of currency transactions (spot, forward, currency) \n* First mover and late mover \n* All about regulatory, normative, and cognitive pillar \n* Civil Law, Common law, theocratic law \n* a few questions about market economy (just pick the one with no government involvement) \n* political risk impact \n* properly and intellectual rights \n* indifference curve \n* definitions for average fixed costs, marginal costs \n* honestly like maybe two questions about demand and supply \n* barriers of entry \n* MR= MC for everything, only price is different for monopolistic, monopoly, and oligopoly \n* Nash Equillibrium and Prisonors Dilemma \n* what increase and decreases money supply! And don\u2019t mix up interest rate with discount rate! \n* Deadweight loss \n* how does tariffs affect price and demand \n* components of gdp and examples \n* consumer and producer surplus \n* cross price elasticity \n* normal and inferior good and demand \n* fiscal policy and affect on demand \n* affect of aggregate demand \n\nYou don\u2019t need to memorize a lot of things as you can understand the concepts such as the perfect, monopolistic, etc competition or the graphs. You can either just draw the graphs to get the answer or use logic such as if supply decreases then quantity will definitely decreases and price will go up because it\u2019s more \u201cdifficult to get\u201d. And remember that there\u2019s only 50 questions so it is usually the main things in every competency that they\u2019ll ask, nothing extremely detailed.\n\nI just took the OA so a lot of it is fresh in my mind.

They seem overwhelming but totally worth it. All of them.\n\nI didn\u2019t take any of the chapter quizzes.\n\nKnow the exact definition of globalization. Know how the demand and supply curve move and why: Which direction (up down, left right), what causes the movement, etc. I drew a lot of the charts which was helpful for understanding but not necessary. Know tariffs. What is PPP? Oligopoly v. monopoly v. perfect competition. What is GDP and GDP inflator? What does it mean for something to be elastic? Non-equity example. Dead weight loss. Market economy, command economy, mixed economy. Also I was surprised there was a mention of who came up with one of the concepts. Consumer surplus, producer surplus. What is a copyright used for? MNE strategies: contender, defender, dodger, extender: understand what they do and why (which ones do abroad\/overseas expansion). Which markets can do short run and long run?

So long story short--this class was, in my opinion, the toughest for me to get over. I'm actually very surprised I managed to complete this course from start to OA finish within 7 days! \n\nSo here's what I did:\n\n1.) Like anyone else, I researched previous posts for tips and guidance and ultimately landed on this strategy. (I highly recommend you follow it to some capacity--it really helped me focus on what I NEEDED to know vs what I could sort of kinda be familiar with.)  \n[https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/WGU\\_MBA\/comments\/1cm1s6d\/c211\\_was\\_not\\_heaven\\_tips\\_on\\_how\\_i\\_passed\\_first\/](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/WGU_MBA\/comments\/1cm1s6d\/c211_was_not_heaven_tips_on_how_i_passed_first\/)\n\nIf I were you, I would memorize the following cheat sheet:\n\n\\- memorize the Market Types and Characteristics of each (brain dump to your whiteboard when you test)  \n\\- \"Harry's Many Friendly Dogs Make Fun, Interesting Playmates, Offering Unique Hugs\" which basically means: \n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/b7dk0uy3a0fe1.png?width=1068&format=png&auto=webp&s=1f5671ba1b7e1afacf731deead0c3164dd9aa31e\n\n\\- draw the Supply and Demand curves (watch this video to learn how: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=kfAuucWr2Do) \n\n\\- know where the Consumer Surplus and Producer Surplus is on a Demand\/Supply curve\n\n\\- know that when the question talks about elasticity and mentions SUBSTITUTION think POSITIVE and COMPLEMENT think NEGATIVE\n\n\\- know what increases or decreases the money supply\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/12xet3uta0fe1.png?width=677&format=png&auto=webp&s=74efe004360bf54221ff4beef94d93ba69b9a0ce\n\n  \n2.) A fellow student shared their notes with me (basically it's the v3 Study Guide with answers filled in already) so I took them and imported to my iPad as a PDF and wrote extra notes as I read through to get a quick overview of what the heck is being tested on. I ONLY watched the main Competency cohort videos while reading through the study guide to help me out. Dr. Baroshi(?) (I forget how you say his name but his videos are wack because he just reads off the slides and isn't helpful.) The true hero is the other Dr. that made most of the videos. \n\n3.) Take as many quizzes as you want (I mainly stuck to the end of chapter quizzes, not the mini quizzes since those questions were on the main end of chapter quizzes)\n\n4.) I downloaded the course textbooks as PDFs and imported them to Google's Notebook LM and asked it questions from the study guide or PA that I needed extra help with and it did a much better job of giving me more relevant answers than ChatGPT, because Notebook LM ONLY uses the data from the textbooks to supply answers--thereby giving me more confidence that the material I was learning was more relevant to what the course PA\/OA questions are like. This helped a lot, but I also used ChatGPT to help me come up with pro tips and acronyms to remember stuff.\n\n5.) I studied for a minimum of 3 hours a day wherever I could find the time--it sucked, but now this test is behind me and it will be for you too!\n\nPro tips that helped me out:\n\n\\- brain dump everything your cheat sheet before answering the first question\n\n\\- The PA is similar to the OA so review your PA and make sure you are familiar and can recognize all the questions because you'll kick yourself when you sit for the OA and see a familiar question you saw on the PA but didn't take the time to figure out how the answer was solved\n\n\\- simplify the question because the questions are worded to try and trick you (for instance, instead of reading something like \"If supply decreases then what happens to price equilibrium and quantity equilibrium?\" Nah forget that, instead simplify it to something like \"If Supply increases, what happens to price and quantity?\" lol\n\n\\- remove answers that you know are incorrect or impossible (like I said, the questions are worded kinda difficult so if you're reading something about tariffs and a few of the answers are about unrelated stuff, rule them out) and use your best guess judgment to make a decision\n\n\\- breath and take your time, there are only 50 questions, so if you know your stuff the test will be quick\n\nI hope this helps! Feel free to hit me up on DM for a copy of my notes. On to the capstone!\n\n","permalink":"\/r\/WGU_MBA\/comments\/1i96cvj\/c211_global_economics_for_managers_passed\/","created_utc":1737753696,"score":39,"text_length":3777,"vader_compound":0.9951,"course_code":"C211"}

At times it felt really hard and at others it felt like common sense. \n\nTask one: really easy, just follow along with the videos. Take the leap and finish this one ASAP.\n\nTask two: a little harder but use the example spreadsheet they provide to plug in the numbers. It does the math for you. You will have to explain the math in the essay but if you use the excel version and click on the results of the answers, it shows you what the equation was. Much simpler that way for me to understand.\n\nThe OA: pretty similar to the PA. I used the jeopardy video and are you smarter than a fifth grader video first. It was a fun way to get my feet wet. Then went back and watched modules 1-7. I definitely thought the bell curve would be more questions but I think there was two, max. I also used the flash cards and took all the quizzes in the chapters.

I watched the videos and took notes and failed the OA and did all the required study material and took it again and failed again.  Then the class transitioned and I thought holy ish is this really happening only to find that the class was actually easier.    \nI realized I need to change my learning method so I took the final in the class material\/book.  I kept studying the concepts until I got it right.   \nI think there are videos in section 5, 7, and 11 that show you how to do the Excel problems.  \nI was getting errors on the bond calculations but another student helped me.  I also used chatgpt to explain things I didn't understand.  For example: explain WACC to me like I'm an 11 year old.  \nSo if I had to do this over I would watch the topic videos and at the end of the section do a knowledge check.    \nIt took me nearly all 3 hours to do the PA and I finished the OA in 2 hours and was cool as a cucumber.

{"post_id":"1hlk9a7","subreddit":"WGU_MBA","title":"C214 - New Course Version ","selftext":"I passed the new version of C214. You will have to download an applet to let them have remote control of your computer to open the excel. The style of the test was exactly like the PA. The entire test is in excel through the excel add in. The questions were not the same as the PA - they were more scenario based than a straight \u201cwhat is ____\u201d question. But if you know the definition you\u2019ll be fine with applying it. \n\nI had form B for the test so if you get that version here\u2019s what was on it:\n\n4 questions on beta in reference to CAPM (didn\u2019t ask for what it was but more of what does a beta > <1 mean, how will the stock move if its beta is = to the market) \n\n3 questions about Gordon Growth \/ CAPM - their weaknesses, shortcomings, assumptions \n\nThere were about 10 math questions - use the formula sheet & you\u2019ll get them right. know the difference between current and long term assets\/liabilities.  for one question, it was calculating the quick ratio (I think?) and it gave you the balance sheet so you had to know which were current\/long term to get it right bc they didn\u2019t state which were what. \n\n3 questions from chapter 1 - regarding the goal of the firm. All of these were scenario based but the answer is always MAXIMIZE SHAREHOLDER VALUE! \n\n5 questions about SEC\/SOX\/FIRNA \n- 3 of mine were about FIRNA , specifically what they do, who they oversee \n- one mentioned some regulation , I think regulation T???? I had never heard of it I had to guess. I know for a fact it wasn\u2019t regulation S \n\n3 questions about chapter 16 global economics \n- the question on the PA about why firms globally finance or something to that nature was almost word for word on the test. The answer was something like firms have more access to debt and equity globally than domestically \n- shortcoming of outsourcing - loss of jobs domestically \n\n2 question about bonds \/ equity - which is debt \/ ownership \n\n1 question about FCFE vs FCFF , what is the difference between the two. FCFE is distributable cash to equity holders & FCFF is distributable cash to debt and equity holders.\n\n1 question about the income statement. If you learn the formula from revenue to net income you\u2019ll get it right. It was something like how do we calculate operating profit from net income. \nRevenue-COGS= Gross Profit - operating expenses =Operating profit\/EBIT - interest=EBT-taxes=net income \n\n1 question on competitive sale. It just asked which is a characteristic of a competitive sale. Underwriter submit bids and the firm picks the highest price and lowest interest rate. \n\n1 question on direct vs indirect method. What is the most popular method used ? I didn\u2019t know so I guessed \n\n1 question about country risk. Just why is it important that firms that firms consider this \n\n3 questions on common stock vs preferred stock. What is characteristics of each\n\n2 questions about diversification. What you expect from your earnings if you diversify \n\n1 question on % of sales method. But it\u2019s just like the PA. It had the same numbers but it just asked you to calculate something else. Like \u201cfind the cash on hand given the percent of sales method\u201d\n\n1 question on why the firm prefers to use debt instead of equity. It\u2019s cheaper & tax shield \n\nI\u2019m definitely missing some but that\u2019s the majority. \n\nFor the excel, just like the PA. All of the bond questions were valuing bonds. If you\u2019re struggling with the math, I recommend learning key phrases for each input to determine if it\u2019s negative or positive. Example - for TVM calculations, I remembered PMT as \u201cpeople save widows\u201d. Payments, savings, withdraws are all negative PMT values. Etc. I did not learn anything about the type. I put type=0 for all of it and hoped for the best. At most if you got everything else right in the question, you\u2019d only lose 0.1 points. A lot of the questions for excel are just like the PA with different numbers. The one PA question that said something along the lines of a bond was purchased 5 years ago at 7%. 2 years later it\u2019s now 9% coupon rate. What\u2019s the value of the bond. That one was on there with different numbers. Same with the saving for rent\/college question. \n\nI only used the textbook. I did not watch any videos for anything. The questions embedded in the chapter are good, but any that are too specific don\u2019t waste your time learning. Most of them won\u2019t be asked as the test is maybe 5 oddly specific questions and the other questions are more main points. \n\nIf anyone wants my notes that I took from the readings, feel free to message me. If you have any other questions, feel free to ask. Good luck!

If I had stayed on track, I would have been able to use the momentum to finish this task much quicker!\n\n**You have to fill out the tactical plan for Q5 and Q6 manually.**  This didn't click for me and I had to get my instructor to clarify for me.  The nice thing is that you don't have to actually have to stick to these numbers for the other tasks.  It's just a projection for the sake of asking for money in the presentation.\n\n**Spend money in the simulation!**  Don't take loans if you don't have to.  Remember that you're asking for money in your presentation, so plan to have a reason to use it.  That could be for things like increasing production capacity or investing in R&D and ERG initiatives.  Much of task 2 is reflecting on these decisions.\n\nI was a scrub for the presentation recording.  I present somewhat regularly for work and hate reading from slides.  **However, for this task, I put a ton of info into my slides and my notes were essentially my slide content verbatim.**  I submitted my first take of the recording in a poorly lit room, standing with a sport coat on and pajama bottoms.  \n\nSubmit Q4 right after you submit the task.  I waited a little while to submit and wasn't able to get going on the next task.  **You can reach out to the capstone group email and they can manually open up the rest of the simulation.**\n\nI passed task 1 in one attempt with no revisions.\n\nTask 2:\n\nI'm not sure if the simulation is the same for everyone, but mine had a scenario where everyone in the industry had to redesign their bikes for a safety concern right in Q5.  I did that, and in Q6 it is implied that *not* doing that would have been a game changer in a very bad way.\n\n[Here's what you need to know about stategic thrusts](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/WGU\/comments\/okqs2t\/c216_thrusts\/)\n\nMy numbers in the balanced scorecard were really bad.  I was generally the company with the industry minimum score in most areas.  Oh well, at least I could talk about it in my task.  If your numbers are bad, it's pretty easy to talk about what decisions you might do differently.\n\nMy paper was 12 pages total, double spaced, with only a handful of screenshots.  I'm not sure why they recommend one part to be 15 pages - that's just excessive.  Also, my template wasn't double spaced.  Make sure you change yours since the directions say to do that.\n\nIf you're using a multiplier for your valuation it seems like you can use anything within reason as long as you can justify it.  I picked 10 because it's easy for multiplication.  Then I said we deserve to charge 10x earnings because we have a decent reputation and hadn't taken on any debt.  I guess this was good enough.\n\nMy task was sent back for one dumb revision.  The evaluator said I hadn't given information about *when* I would have implemented a change regarding one of my decisions that I would have changed.  It literally took me less than 5 minutes to make the change with one sentence and resubmit.  Oh well, I kind of expected them to require more revisions so I won't complain.  \n\nTask 3:\n\nI finished task 3 while waiting for the simulation to open back up after task 1.  This one was very easy and I finished on the first attempt.  I don't really have any tips on this one other than don't waste any time starting it.  It's logically the last thing you'd work on for your capstone but you could work on it as soon as the capstone is opened for you.  It does not depend on the simulation at all.  \n\nHope this helps!  Overall, I'd say task 2 took the most amount of time for me but none of the capstone is particularly difficult.  \n\n  \n","permalink":"\/r\/WGU_MBA\/comments\/1h88i6e\/my_tips_for_the_capstone_c216\/","created_utc":1733510690,"score":39,"text_length":3769,"vader_compound":0.9767,"course_code":"C216"}

Thanks in advance!\n\nUpdate: Hey guys, I finished this class last week and wanted to update you all. So the OA was not bad at all. I recommend watching the 10 videos under the efficient study plan, within course resources. Personally, I recommend watching the videos 2-3 times each; the first time watch only, no notes, the second time take notes and can speed up to 1.25-1.50, the 3rd time if necessary, speed up to 1.75. Also for each concept I didn\u2019t understand, I had ChatGPT give me a 20 question mock quiz (10concept and 10 calculation questions). Lastly, make sure to take the interactive quiz at the end.

I'm just a Soldier and a Law Enforcer, pushing to get ahead in life and chase down some big goals. So, if you're frustrated and wonder \"What the heck am I supposed to study?\" I've been there, too. This is precisely why I recently gave some tips to help you push past those initial overwhelming thoughts. So you can move forward more clearly and (hopefully) save time compared to my journey.\n\nRemember, \"Consistency is the Miracle.\" We are both so close to \"the finish line and at this point, we can't afford to stop. So don't be idle; let's cross this finish line together! You've got this.\n\n# Step 1\n\n# [https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/WGU\\_MBA\/comments\/1cm1s6d\/c211\\_was\\_not\\_heaven\\_tips\\_on\\_how\\_i\\_passed\\_first\/](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/WGU_MBA\/comments\/1cm1s6d\/c211_was_not_heaven_tips_on_how_i_passed_first\/)\n\nI found this post and the MRU videos helpful in my daily lunch breaks to review and practice what I learned. You will find that they are helpful and should be incorporated into daily education.\n\n# Step 2\n\nI'm not a fan of the book because it took forever to understand, and the quizzes did not help me understand the topics or prepare me for the pre-assessment. So, I created the following quizlet from other creators who have already done this work for you.\n\n[https:\/\/quizlet.com\/user\/Oz\\_Ramos5\/folders\/c211?i=ytnwg&x=1xqt](https:\/\/quizlet.com\/user\/Oz_Ramos5\/folders\/c211?i=ytnwg&x=1xqt)\n\n# Step 3\n\nI went to course tips, and you will find a study guide\/videos on what you should be covering in the book. Yes, this helps, but I have no interest in doing this every week when I would rather play video games or play with my kids (live instead of being a drone). So, I created the following to help you (not enable you). These study guides took me 5 months to complete because of (understanding concepts and cross-referencing answers).\n\nI've attached them so you can look at my take on how I learn, and you will find that I put references in each section with (1-3a) or (chapter-section) to see my reference for my answer. If it's not there, it ought to give her the answer and clean it up with CHATGPT. Notice that my study guide is thorough and lengthy!  \n[C211 Resources](https:\/\/westerngovernorsuniversity-my.sharepoint.com\/:f:\/r\/personal\/oramo26_wgu_edu\/Documents\/C211%20Resources?csf=1&web=1&e=3fiz4H): The link has an expiration date. If you message me, I can create a new link.\n\nI used Obsidian as my note-taking and building tool, so if you aren't accustomed to this, I challenge you to build your own with your creative twist.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nI found this course challenging and less helpful to my learning than I had hoped. It often felt like I was the Instructor, the student, and the teacher all at once. While self-directed study is a significant part of WGU\u2019s approach, this course is more like, \u201cHere\u2019s the material\u2014good, \"rather than a guided learning experience.\n\nThe course materials, including videos and the textbook, were hard to follow or needed more clarity. Practical, interactive support was also minimal. For instance, the provided practice packets didn\u2019t always align well with actual tasks, making it challenging to gauge progress or identify improvement areas.\n\nOverall, it would be helpful if the course offered more structured guidance, precise explanations, and better-aligned practice resources to support independent learning more effectively.","permalink":"\/r\/WGU_MBA\/comments\/1grc6bt\/c211_and_why_it_took_me_5_months_to_prepare\/","created_utc":1731610424,"score":8,"text_length":3000,"vader_compound":0.9973,"course_code":"C211"}

This was probably the worst course in the MBA program for me because it contained the most new information for me.  I've also previously obtained an MSITM degree from WGU and this was my first\/only course that had PA and OA requirements for passing, and this definitely created a roadblock in my mind.\n\nMy main tip for passing the OA is to **pass both performance assessments first!**  The PAs in this course are a little different in the fact that they have how-to videos that basically teach you how to complete the PAs *and* they teach you some of the concepts that are on the OA.  I had to resubmit both PAs for this course and learned a bit more along the way.\n\nAnother tip that I want to get on the record on Reddit is that the **preassessment for the OA is close enough to the OA to be helpful.**  I had read some previous posts that said the preassessment and OA were significantly different from each other and that caused me to procrastinate.\n\nI decided to bring my calculator for the OA which helped a bit.  However, I forgot to bring my whiteboard and it would have been really helpful when I had a question about finding the median from a group of numbers in random order.  **Bring your calculator and whiteboard.**\n\nMy final tip is just to **listen to the recordings for the first 6ish chapters of the course content.**  You don't really need to dedicate all of your focus to them.  I've completed most of my MBA my listening to course videos while playing videogames at the same time.  Of course I end up replaying them a few times to let the content really sink in.  \n","permalink":"\/r\/WGU_MBA\/comments\/1gp14jy\/my_tips_for_the_c207_oa\/","created_utc":1731354203,"score":22,"text_length":1695,"vader_compound":0.797,"course_code":"C207"}

Honestly glad I went ahead and just took the OA because I would have spent forever studying trying to remember everything. \n\nAnyways, here\u2019s what worked well for me \n\n1. As soon as I started the course I watch the Dr V bootcamp video at normal speed. Most of these concepts were brand new to me and not everything made sense in the moment, but I took great notes and got most of the main concepts seeded in my brain. \n\n2. Watches all 7 ESP videos. They\u2019re About 30 minutes each so really only like 3.5 hours of time. I found these to be really helpful. Once you finish the videos, take the ESP concepts practice quiz and the calculation concepts quiz. After watching Dr V bootcamp and these 7 videos you will be proficient with the financial calculator. As long as you can do the keystrokes from these two resources, you can pass the math from the OA. it\u2019s simple math, but you just have to figure out what the question is asking and how to get the answer by algebraically manipulating the formulas. \n\n3. Study the 222 Quizlet. This is extremely important. Memorize the whole thing. Trust me. \n\n4. Watch Dr V bootcamp one more time. I think I watched it on 1.5X or 2X the second time around. This is when a lot of the concepts really clicked for me. \n\nAfter I did those four things I took the PA passed, and immediately took the OA. In my opinion, The OA was fairly similar to the PA. There was one question that I literally had no idea how calculate the answer and just ended up guessing. But everything else was comparable to the PA. \n\nThis course is a BEAST, best of luck to everyone who is working on it!

I have a spouse who has assumed all household chores and parenting duties including practices and games while working their own full time job.  I also have a full time job and am a people leader from the trenches, but I have the priviledge of leadership who believes that doing school work on the job between tasks makes perfect business sense.

I have never been more frustrated.  \n\nKeep in mind that I received my BS from WGU as well, so I'm quite familiar with proctoring.  \n\nWhy did I have to take pics of my ID and all of my surroundings just to have to redo it live?  One may never know, but that's not what is frustrating.\n\nI had already unplugged, covered, and moved my second monitor behind my first monitor.  Phone was upstairs.  Clear bottle of water on my desk. Calculator and clean whiteboard present along with whiteboard pen and eraser.  \n\nFirst, the proctor became angrier and angrier that I would not show them where my phone was.  We  were speaking, but thinking there was a language barrier, I typed it in the chat.  She would NOT accept my phone was on another floor.  I just finally told her I didn't own one and to move on.  \n\nThen, she wanted me to unplug my laptop and remove it from my desk.  We had a full 6 minute conversation as to why that wasn't possible, both verbally and in chat.  At one point she told me to disconnect my monitor and just use my laptop.  My monitors are 24 inch television screens.  No way my tired, old eyes were going to focus on a small laptop screen at 10pm.  When she found out my keyboard, not needed for the C213 exam, was in my ergonomical desk drawer, she lost her shit.  \n\nAll of this before my scheduled 9:30 pm exam even started, and we were half an hour in so far. I finally opened up a desk drawer, took out a pen and post-it, and wrote down her name.  I held it to the  camera and asked her if it was spelled correctly, because I was going to leave a bad survey and make a complaint.  I was finally able to begin my exam nearly 40 minutes after the scheduled time, and it took two of the three allotted hours.  \n\nGood news is that I began my MBA program on July 1st, and I am five classes down and working on six.  Bad news is that I'm afraid I'm going to have to fill my water bottle with other clear liquids if ProctorU doesn't get their shit together.  Like nearly all of us, I am in a full-time+ career and have a family--four college kids and two in elementary.

I passed it first go, and I wanted to leave my tips in case it helps anyone at all.\n\n1. Do not read the e text. \nListen to the professor and do NOT read or engage with the course material OR any other outside source. Trust when I say everything you need to know is within the webinar videos. He does a super good job in explaining concepts and formulas and connecting everything together.\n\n2. Get the calculator.\nThis OA.. I wouldn\u2019t have been able to do it period without the calculator. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s something anyone is debating doing, but you 100% need it for tvm and bond valuation calculations. Just get it. BA II plus, TI.\n\n3. Do the practice.\nI would say most of the questions that trip people up are the calculations, and if you arent 100% comfortable with how to do them, you might not pass, because the calculation questions make up a huge portion of the OA. In the same document with the videos there is a link to a ton of practice questions, and they\u2019re super helpful and aligned to the test.\n\n4. Don\u2019t listen to people saying it\u2019s impossible.\nSo many people had shrouded this test in anxiety for me, and it really had an effect on the time I completed it in. Everyone has different strengths and if you were okay at algebra in high school you\u2019re good to go. Most people that have fear surrounding this class are those whose strengths lie in narrative academics. Just trust me, you\u2019ll be fine.\n\n5. Study schedule.\nGive yourself a whole day to study each session and I guarantee you\u2019ll pass in a week. Dedicate the last day to practicing calculations and get ready to pass one of the harder classes in this degree.\n\nYou got this!!!!<3","permalink":"\/r\/WGU_MBA\/comments\/1d1x7o9\/c214_nice\/","created_utc":1716831602,"score":26,"text_length":1792,"vader_compound":0.9859,"course_code":"C214"}

I spent 4-5 hours each of those days writing it out, then my brain was toast haha\n\nLike everyone says, write to the rubric and you'll find success. \n\nTask 1: Use one of the recommended topics they give you and answer prompt questions. You have to get it accepted by your course instructor. Took me 20 minutes.\n\nTask 2: This paper asks you to plan out your topic for use. The SWOT analysis, GAP Analysis weren\u2019t too hard. Then creating a solution for the GAP Analysis is easy if you think about the solutions while you\u2019re writing it out. The part that took the longest for me for this paper was the Summary of Other Works section. I spent maybe 2 hours reading through articles that aligned with my topic. Once I found the ones I needed it was fairly easy to write about it. It just takes time. (12 pages total: 9 pages of writing, including title, contents, and references pages.)\n\nTask 3: This paper is again just long. It builds on the Gap Analysis Solution portion of Task 2.

How is the business going to add it to their processes?

On top of that, I didn't input any projections on quarters 5 and 6 on quarter 4's tactical plan before I submitted it either. I've gone back and forth with my CI and of course they say you can't go in and change it, that I have to do it manually from here on out, then submit that version of the tactical plan with task 1. My question is, I know that the numbers\/projections for quarters 5 and 6 are merely projections (financial uncertainty), but since I have to manually enter 5 and 6 in, should I keep quarter 4 numbers the same as what I submitted in the simulation, or would it be ok to change them around a little bit since I've caught some errors I have made. Any input ANYONE would have would be greatly appreciated.

The moment my exam started I wrote down my abbreviated version of this table on my whiteboard\n2. Draw a supply and demand curve on your white board and include consumer surplus and producer surplus on there. Know which way the supply and demand curves move and what that does to price and quantity\n3. I printed out the Key Terms and Definitions in the course resources and read these twice and made notes\n   1. Globalization definition verbatim\n4. I did use the completed V3 study guide that was found on Facebook MBA group and made notes. It is approximately 81 pages so I didn't print but took notes in Noteability on my iPad. It does a great job of going over most of the topics but I filled it in with my own thoughts\n5. Non-equity and equity examples\n6. Nobody I have seen has talked about this but [MRU.org](http:\/\/MRU.org) had some amazing videos on Macro and Microeconomics. I did not watch them all but I would review topics I was struggling with and they explained them in a very fun and engaging way.\n   1. [https:\/\/mru.org\/principles-economics-microeconomics](https:\/\/mru.org\/principles-economics-microeconomics)\n   2. [https:\/\/mru.org\/principles-economics-macroeconomics-0](https:\/\/mru.org\/principles-economics-macroeconomics-0)\n   3. You can use the search feature just to look up topics or things you want elaboration on\n7. There was only one question where I had to subtract and it was related to consumer or producer surplus\n8. Know what will increase and decrease the money supply\n   1. Increase Money Supply\n      1. Open Market buy bonds\n      2. Decrease Discount Window Rate\n      3. Decrease Required Reserve\n      4. Increases Aggregate Demand\n   2. Decrease Money Supply\n      1. OM sell\n      2. Increase DWR\n      3. Increase RRR\n      4. Decrease AD\n9. Cross Price Elasticity of Demand\n   1. Positive relation for substitutes\n   2. Negative relation for complements\n10. Items that shift DEMAND curve \"PINTE\"\n   1. Price of related goods (substitutes and compliments)\n   2. Income (normal and inferior)\n   3. Number of buyers\n   4. Tastes and preferences\n   5. Expectations of future (expect price to fall soon)\n11. Items that shift SUPPLY curve \"iNOTE\"\n   1. input prices\n   2. number of sellers (more sellers more supply)\n   3. outside options of sellers\n   4. tech (increases productivity)\n   5. expectations of future (holding inventory)\n12. Costs and Benefits of FDI (I know I got this wrong on exam)\n13. The 4 strategies to fight MNE\n   1. Some really stupid ways I remembered them\n      1. Contender and Extender have \"t\"s so I remembered those as TRANSFERABLE\n      2. \"Sold out DODGEr's stadium\" - company sells out \n      3. \"DEFEND\" home plate - home market advantage\n14. I had a diamond theory question\n15. Hedging, types of currency transactions\n16. It wasn't just enough to know what regulatory, normative, and cognitive pillars were they had questions that were like \"which two are examples of \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ pillar\" so make sure you understand this\n17. Totalitarinism, Deomcracy definitions\n18. Market, Command, and Mixed economy\n19. 3 types of barriers to entry that can lead to a monopoly\n20. GDP\n21. Impact of tariffs\n22. Deadweight loss\n   1. The value of the trades not made b\/c of tax or tariff\n\nI know I typed a bunch and this is kind of all I can remember (I had a few glasses of wine while I was working on my Capstone stuff). I probably would say I studied diligently for about a week and really focused this past Saturday and Sunday. I did all the quizzes in Cengage but did not actually read any of the textbooks (despite my previous posts). I will just suggest [MRU.org](http:\/\/MRU.org) once again because the videos are well organized and cover the material in a way that's fun. I only took the PA once the day I opened the course and failed it and didn't take it again.\n\nOpen the Course Tips and that's where the Key Terms, C211 recorded cohorts videos, and additional resources by competency (I watched all the short content videos).\n\nHope I paid it forward because this subreddit has been a huge resource in my journey. I am going to finish in a single term and I can't believe it. New house, new job, and soon new degree all before June 2024.

I absolutely hated how some calculation problems have you jumping through a few steps to arrive at the answer.\n\nNote that I did not read the e-text at all as most everyone said it didn't help at all and only wasted time. For the webinar videos off panopto, make sure you watch each at least 3 times.  take notes on concepts and calculation method for different types of problems each time  you watch the video.  Follow along and practice using the BA II Plus calculator so you're familiar with the order of key presses - this is especially important for IRR\/NPV problems.

{"post_id":"1bbvzb2","subreddit":"WGU_MBA","title":"Tips for C213","selftext":"This class has a lot of information but it's fairly simple in the grand scheme of things. The PA and OA both give you a formula bar on the lefthand side. The PA and OA are also very similar so if you ace the practice, you should do alright on the real thing. You will do well if you know basic algebra. It's a lot of solving for x where you have the formula and most of the variables.\n\nThe questions on the PA and OA can get wordy to try and trip you up. I found it helped to skip the \"preamble\" and go straight to the last line of what's actually being asked. If they ask for the impact of a transaction on March 1, you don't need to know what happened on any of the other days. Similarly, if they ask about what choice to make with respect to the selling price, don't try and make changes to the cost when they are only concerned with the selling price.\n\nSome really simple and broad ways to think about common terms that might help you:  \nAssets are things that you can use or sell to pay bills  \nLiabilities are things that you are responsible to pay for now or in the future  \nEquity is the \"value\" in your company left over after the first two\n\nI don't remember actually needing to put together a statement of cash flows, just needing to know what the different sections are and what transactions fall under each section:  \nOperating is current assets or current liabilities (paying salaries, buying inventory, etc.)  \nInvesting is long term assets (buying a new building)  \nFinancing is long term liabilities (multi-year loans you have to pay) or equity (stock)\n\nCVP breaks down like this:  \nSales (Selling Price Per Unit x Units) - Variable Costs (Cost Per Unit x Units) - Fixed Costs = Target  \nWhen you need to figure out break-even price, your Target is 0 and you work backwards from there\n\nCash collection works like this:  \nIf 65% of sales are collected in cash, that means 35% is on credit, because all sales add up to 100%  \nThat means if you collect 10% of credit sales in the following month, the amount is Sales x .35 x .10\n\nWhat you'll need to know about financial statements:  \nInfo which needs to be disclosed but isn't an actual transaction is put in the notes  \nPurposely making it look like the company made more money than it did is fraud  \nAccidentally making it look like the company made more money than it did is a mistake  \n\"Stretching the truth\" to make financials look better without fake transactions is a disagreement  \nMethod of calculating depreciation needs to be disclosed\n\n\n\nI probably didn't provide enough detail but it's because I found this class to be a breeze if I am being honest.

In the meantime I reviewed my coaching report, went through the flashcards again, and studied some concepts I saw on the PA that I wasn't familiar with (another redditor said that if you saw a concept of the PA, it's sister concept, such as mercantilism and absolute advantage, would be on the OA)\n\n6. OA. I did pass first time, but I felt the questions were very different from the PA. In style and the concepts they covered. Maybe two were verbatim, a few similar, but the rest completely different. My advice is to know the concepts well and be able to reason through the questions. \n\nPosting because I learned so much about strategies for moving through these courses from reddit, so I'm hoping my experience can help\/encourage someone else! \n\nHooray for last exam of my MBA!

{"post_id":"1ajogvb","subreddit":"WGU_MBA","title":"Tips for AFT2","selftext":"Easily my least favorite class thus far. The assignments seem so disjointed in terms of what they're trying to accomplish. The rubrics are written in a vague, generic way that I'm not sure the CIs or evaluators truly know what is being asked and you kinda just have to get lucky that someone likes your submission. Some were perfect on first pass while others got dragged through the mud. I do think there are some obvious bullet points that you definitely need to touch on, but in my experience, successful completion also requires a ton of patience.\n\nBefore you even start writing, expand the \"Announcements\" section on the right and bookmark\/save the link. You'll need to refer to it for Tasks 1 and 4. You're also going to want to go to the Assessments tab for each task and download the artifacts zip file at the bottom then extract the zip file.\n\nTask 1: Go into the artifacts and choose a review section you're interested in. You'll find some codes associated with that section that you need to look up on the website you saved\/bookmarked. The initials for those codes correspond to the abbreviations on the left hand bar e.g. NPSG is National Patient Safety Goals, IC is Infection Control, etc. Write a quick description of what the three different standards you chose are. Now this is where it gets slightly confusing. There are some artifacts that you downloaded which are labeled according to the area you chose. Go back to the website and click the standards for the area you chose. You're going to see them expand and show numbered lists. You have to compare the artifacts to these numbered lists and write a short description about whether or not they match up, don't match up or you can't find anything. The easiest way that worked for me was\n\n* Standard: Standard Description\n   * EP Number: This is in compliance because of \\_\\_\\_\\_ document that has the same policy\n   * EP Number: This is not in compliance because the website says you need A, B, and C but I could not find anything to support that this policy is in place\n\nYou do this until you've touched on all three standards and all the elements under each one\n\nThen you write a plan to fix each EP that you said wasn't in compliance. They are looking for concrete actions, who is going to be enforcing those actions, when they are going to be doing them, who gets in trouble if the actions aren't enforced, how you'll track that this policy is being enforced, and what success looks like when the policy is enforced. Lastly you write a justification for why you chose the section you did but DON'T apply it to the scenario. That's another confusing part. You have to make it general. It's about why the section is important to healthcare in general, not this specific scenario.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTask 2: The first part involves writing a super detailed re-telling of the summary and transcript you downloaded in the artifacts for this task. This part is super easy because all you are doing is just restating what's already been said and done. Mary did this, John did that, etc. The most important thing to remember is to include literally everything. If Mary farted, write that she farted. No detail is irrelevant. After you've done that, you need to write about how you would improve the interactions between these deeply miserable people LOL. They all have a gripe and you essentially need to come up with a solution or solutions that touch on all of their complaints. Next you have to fix the real problem. Some of the characters actually suggest a fix in the story so you can just use theirs. Make sure that you provide a quality improvement system and a root cause analysis with your fix. There are plenty of fishbone diagram templates online that you can just fill out and post into your paper. Lastly, you are describing what you'll need to put these changes into place e.g. money, cooperation, materials, etc. This is probably the most straightforward task.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTask 3: This is the easiest task by far. Describe how the hospital has been making this patient's life hell by paraphrasing the summary. Open up the tracer, find a problem that interests you, and then match it up with the standard\/EP from that website which would have prevented that from happening if it were in place. Then write a plan to fix it using the same method as in Task 1. They are looking for concrete actions, who is going to be enforcing those actions, when they are going to be doing them, who gets in trouble if the actions aren't enforced, how you'll track that this policy is being enforced, and what success looks like when the policy is enforced.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTask 4: Pull up the website and make note of the 18 categories on the left sidebar. Any category that's on that left sidebar but not in the Accreditation Function column of the FSA Findings artifact is in compliance. Just write a sentence or two about what the standard is for and say that the medical facility is following it. For the categories that are in the document, you have to restate all of the problems grouped by that category. If it's the same problem, just in different parts of the hospital, make note of this for the next section. You need to write about at least two trends that you noticed when reviewing the findings. Find a matching standard on the website that would address both of those problematic trends. Next you are reviewing the Staffing Effectiveness Report and seeing if there are any times where patients are suffering because the nurses are overworked. Write about if you see a connection or not. The last part is confusing because you basically just have to make it up. You have to write up a plan of how to fix the staffing issue you found that was causing patient injuries. You can just Google common nursing staffing plans and parrot what you found out without going too deep into detail. This is like two assignments combined into one so it's a bit lengthy but not terrible.","permalink":"\/r\/WGU_MBA\/comments\/1ajogvb\/tips_for_aft2\/","created_utc":1707159690,"score":16,"text_length":5948,"vader_compound":0.9952,"course_code":"AFT2"}

Both in my undergrad and now in this grad program, many WGU students and course mentors have the worst 'Bedside manners' in dealing with students. What is so hard with reaching out and saying something like, 'Hey we noticed you didn't pass the OA, how can we help? What were your sticking points?....' This is especially true when they know full well this is one of the most difficult courses for students with no accounting background.   \n\n\nSo, I'm looking for suggestions on passing this danged course if any has anything for me.

{"post_id":"1is5qj1","subreddit":"WGU_MSDA","title":"Tips for Navigating the D608 Udacity Course","selftext":"I've seen a couple of topics in other threads about the Udacity course that is required for D608.  I just finished the final project, so I want to share some information that others may find helpful.\n\n* **Materials are Outdated and Disorganized** \\- As mentioned in [this post](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/WGU_MSDA\/comments\/1i17orn\/udacity_assessments_beginning_to_appear_as\/) and [this post](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/WGU_MSDA\/comments\/1ifykq9\/a_big_ol_post_about_the_data_engineering\/), the Udacity course materials are old and obviously recycled from earlier iterations.  Sadly, they are disorganized and poorly implemented.  It's still worth going through the course to see the videos, but take everything with a grain of salt if it doesn't work. I had a little prior experience using Airflow, so I was able to infer what they intended, but I would NOT recommend this Udacity course as a competent introduction to Airflow.  If you're new to Airflow, maybe look for some other resources on Linked In Learning or YouTube and then come back here once you have a general understanding of the concepts.\n* **Follow Lesson 3 for Setup** \\- If you know Airflow, you may be tempted to skip lessons in the course. However, you will want to follow the steps outlined in the Lesson 3 to create an IAM AWS User, setup your workgroups\/namespaces, create the Redshift database, and setup the connections in Airflow.  You'll need all of this setup for the final project.  If you work through the exercises, you can save yourself some time.  Just watch your AWS budget.\n* **Setup Docker and VS Code Locally** \\- Do yourself a favor and setup Docker and VS Code on your local machine.  There is a docker-compose file in the final project that you can use if you're not familiar with running Airflow in Docker.  The course does have an option to use VS Code directly in the browser, but it is **very** clunky to use.  I started the course in-browser but eventually switched to Docker out of frustration.\n* **AWS Credits and Redshift Management** \\- The course gives you $25 of AWS credits for the entire course.  You'll use that to start\/stop Redshift databases and to work with the JSON data in the S3 buckets.  The course guides you toward Redshift Serverless, which is a great idea for saving credits.  However, they don't tell you that if your serverless instance has a public IP address, you're burning credits.  Leaving the IP address available for about 20 hours used over half of my course budget.  Ouch.  In retrospect, I probably should have thought of this, but I didn't.  Unless you're actively working with Redshift, open the workgroup in the AWS dashboard and uncheck the box that makes it public.  A few minutes later, AWS spins down your usage to zero.\n* **AWS Login Issues** \\- To login credentials for AWS are finicky.  If it says invalid, navigate to a different page in Udacity, the click the Cloud Resources tab, then click the login button.  You may have to do this a couple of times and\/or refresh the Udacity page.  Eventually the page \"catches up\" and gives you a valid link.\n* **Avoid using Cloudshell for Data Copying** \\- Lesson 3.6 encourages you to use AWS Cloudshell to copy data from the instructor's S3 bucket into the home directory of the shell and then into your own bucket.  It works well enough for the course (if you're using the in-browser VS Code) but this does NOT work for the final.  The datasets are too large.  I wasted a ton of time and credits trying to copy the final.  Eventually the home directory of the Cloudshell fills up and the process aborts and\/or times out.  For what it's worth: in the final course, I was able to use the S3 bucket directly without copying it first.  You need to know the region of the original bucket, which is us-west-2.\n* **Custom Operators in Final Project** \\- The starter code they give you for the final project has some syntax problems with the implementation of passing arguments to Custom Operators, particularly with super function.  I chased this problem for ***far*** too long because the error description wasn't pointing me in the right direction.  The course materials are pretty terrible here as well.  The instructor video just scrolls around in the code without really explaining anything of value.  Go read the documentation for how Custom Operators are implemented in [Airflow 1](https:\/\/airflow.apache.org\/docs\/apache-airflow\/1.10.13\/howto\/custom-operator.html) vs [Airflow 2](https:\/\/airflow.apache.org\/docs\/apache-airflow\/stable\/howto\/custom-operator.html) and save yourself hours of frustration.\n* **Delete airflow1 folder from Final Project** \\- I completed the final project in Airflow 2 and therefore only changed the files in the main folders.  However, the evaluator initially returned my work without grading it because I did not delete the airflow1 folder.  In theory, they could have seen this using version control (since I made zero changes to those files) but maybe their grading process makes that difficult.  Take a moment to delete whatever version you don't use before you commit\/submit.\n\nAs I mentioned above, I'd highly recommend using local tools, but if you find yourself needing (or wanting) to use the in-browser instance of VS Code for the course, here's some other info that might help:\n\n* **Exercise File Location** \\- The in-browser instance VS Code pages often have instructions telling you \"Open Before Beginning\" and list a random path.  The wording is poor, but they want you to launch the workspace and then open that file.  But they also only give you a partial path.  Open \"\/home\/workspace\/airflow\/dags\/\" from inside VS Code and then you should be able to navigate through the rest of the path.\n* **Connections and Variables script** \\- The in-browser instance of VS Code also has is a file named \"set\\_connections\\_and\\_variables.sh\" that lives in the \/home\/workspace folder.  This shell script executes in the terminal automatically immediately after you launch the workspace.  The course wants you to configure things in the user interface and then edit this file to make the same changes programmatically.  To help, the script has a command you can use in the terminal to see the settings (after they are created in the UI).  You're expected to run those commands, copy the output, and edit the script to have your settings automatically load.  IMHO, this feels like a hack, but I suppose it's better than retyping\/reconfiguring Airflow on every single exercise.\n* **Automatically Starting Airflow** \\- As you move through the exercises in Lesson 2, you'll want to continue editing this file to save what you do.  If you run something at the command line, you'll probably want to add the same info into the set\\_connections\\_and\\_variables script.  For example, by the time I was several steps into Lesson 2, my script had several lines at the top to automatically launch airflow and re-create my admin account like this:\n\n`\/opt\/airflow\/start-services.sh`  \n`\/opt\/airflow\/start.sh`  \n`airflow users create --email` [`myemailaddress@wgu.edu`](mailto:myemailaddress@wgu.edu) `--firstname John --lastname Smith --password admin --role Admin --username admin`  \n`nohup airflow scheduler &> \/dev\/null &`\n\nHope someone else is able to find this useful.

Additionally, there is a bug in scholarship universe that didn't allow me to apply for scholarships, and I found out it will take 13 to 14 weeks for my financial aid to be disbursed. I maxed out my undergrad loans so they have to do a lengthy review to make sure I'm eligible for grad loans. I borrowed extra to give myself a bit of a cushion.

Fever, chills, cough, the whole nine.\n\nY'all, I cannot describe how angry I am right now. Every time I try to improve my life it shit just goes haywire.

Materials are from different locations, and then you will end up in Udacity and discover a D609 nanodegree. This nanodegree is about AWS and how to implement Lakehouse architecture through different AWS tools like Glue(AWS version of Apache Spark). It gives you AWS credentials to play around with different services, such as IAM, S3, Glue, Athena etc.\n\nAt the end of that nanodegree is a project called STEDi human balance project. I did that project and submitted it to Udacity, where I got a degree. I ran out of credits 2 times, and when you run out of credits, it deletes your work. I spent many hours and more than a week on it, and they said that people normally do not run out of credits. It came out that some AWS Glue service(the one you preview data in Glue) kept running over 2 days, and it trained my account.\n\nNow, the fun part - back to WGU, they want you to write a paper or proposal on implementing this STEDi project in Azure. Everything you learned and the nanodegree achieved is obsolete here. So basically, now one will have Azure documentation and AWS documentation side by side and try to find out which services in Azure can be used to achieve Datalake architecture in STEDi project.\n\nDo you need a nanodegree to pass the course - no. If the goal is to accelerate through the program, no matter what, one can skip it. But I am in this program to learn new things, so I went full in, and it was fun actually to play around in AWS. In my workplace, we do not utilize AWS Cloud much in data engineering, so it was good to play there.","permalink":"\/r\/WGU_MSDA\/comments\/1hx32vk\/d609_data_analytics_at_scale\/","created_utc":1736391950,"score":6,"text_length":1713,"vader_compound":0.976,"course_code":"D609"}

The task requirements are very...copy\/paste feel in some places, and I feel, at least, do not do a good job of explaining what you are supposed to do.\n\nSo, let's go through some recommendations I have about dealing with the tasks without going over everything in too much detail:\n\nFor ALL Tasks:\n\n* Include a zipped version of your GitLab files for that task (In case of access issues)\n* GitLab history can literally be just a screenshot of the history page\n* You do not need to create new branches per task; keeping them all in a \"working\\_branch\" is fine. I still separated them into different folders, though.\n* Camera recording of yourself is NOT required. A recent policy change made it so you only need to screenshare. If you don't care, including your camera will not harm you, but if you don't like to be on camera, ensure you include a comment about this policy change in the comments to the evaluator.\n* My Panopto presentation for each was just me stepping through a Jupyter notebook and explaining what each section did with a brief overview or summary of the result. (5-8min long)\n* Include a screenshot of every visual you make in the Word document!\n* I used Jupyter Notebook, as I listed above, and VS Code for my IDE. VS Code supports Jupyter Notebook and supports using the Anaconda kernel while also making it easy to push changes to GitLab. Highly recommend.\n\nTask 1:\n\n* The book is useful for understanding linear regression but is also pretty boring and a little outdated (some functions moved around in certain modules, unnecessary utility functions for stepwise selection). Highly recommend checking out Vitthal Srinivasan and Janani Ravi on Pluralsight as supplementary material\n* Validate all of your assumptions. For any algorithm with assumptions, ensure you are meeting those assumptions! Especially if you are performing correlation analysis for your variable selection.\n\nTask 2:\n\n* I didn't really like the material they provided for this. I mainly did my own research and used some Pluralsight classes by the same people listed above.\n* This class is even more strict about validating your assumptions, so yeah, make sure you at least read that article they include in the course content on how to do this. I even took a couple of functions from it to use in my analysis; just make sure you give the author credit in a comment. (I also did in the word doc)\n\nTask 3:\n\n* It may be just me, but this was the most confusing task to read. But rest assured, it is actually just as simple as it sounds. Take what you did for Task 1, change the dependent variable, and perform the exact same analysis.... seriously. Just take out any categorical variables if you used any (Remember, Binary variables are categorical!)\n* Once you've done that, go somewhere in there before you do the optimized model and perform PCA with your variables. Just provide exactly what it asks for. For the matrix, they want a matrix showing the principal components along the columns and variable names along the rows with the weight of each variable used in that component listed. Pretty simple.\n* You do not have to use the results of your PCA for anything! Makes no sense to me, but just make sure you still check for assumptions (even in the linear regression analysis)\n\nIf you have any questions as you go through, leave a reply, and I'll update the above with more answers if I forgot anything. Just try not to overthink it too much.","permalink":"\/r\/WGU_MSDA\/comments\/1fw91xf\/d600_psa\/","created_utc":1728073939,"score":30,"text_length":3561,"vader_compound":0.9959,"course_code":"D600"}

I only studied ZyBooks, doing the chapters and labs suggested in the course notes over two months. When I needed a better explanation of things, I'd check in with ChatGPT. I tried to make sure that I understood WTH I was doing and why before moving on to the next exercise. By the end of the course I would usually finish an exercise in multiple ways just to compare solutions. Getting this score is unbelievably validating when I wasn't so sure that I would make a decent programmer. I also confirmed during this course that I love programming -- I have spent entire days at the keyboard and enjoy making solutions in code.\n\nI can confirm that as of last night, if you can comfortably work through the practice tests (33 and 34 -- especially 34) and then the WGU pre-assessment then you should be able to pass the exam. There was one CSV problem, one open-read-write file problem, and one tricky variation on the 'making change' problem that involved time instead of currency. They were remarkably similar to what we learn in ZyBooks. The remaining 12-13 problems were typical branching logic and conditional challenges. Perhaps the only things I have to add to what others have already said about it are the following:\n\n* Read the directions. Read them again.\n* Stick to ZyBooks. I don't know how I would have dealt with the exam interface in ZyBooks if I hadn't already gotten accustomed to all of the whitespace issues and just how to use it.\n* Do what the question tells you to do. If it says to use open(), read(), and write()... do so. Don't use 'with' or anything that makes more sense.\n* You're not graded on elegance, you're graded on correct output.\n* ONLY do what they instruct you to do. I did not add any error-checking unless they asked for it. If they say that you need three integer inputs, add them and don't add anything to handle strings or floats.\n* I never had to use print's 'end' method during the exam, but Every. Output. Ends. With. A. Newline. Check your whitespace by drag-selecting over your output to make sure it matches what it's supposed to look like.\n* If your output looks good, read the directions again. Check your results.\n* Finally, ZyBooks' interface and code parser is a minor pita but having to deal with its fickle nature dramatically improved my accuracy. I'm not here to get a degree per se, I'm here to become a good programmer.\n\nOver the course of these two months, I also started programming my own digital spellbook python script that I can use as a reference tool when I run my weekly D&D game. I would work on it when I was getting bored or tired of study and it allowed me to work with what I'd learned in a different and interesting way for me.

First it took me longer I think than most based on my personal circumstances (3years). But I believe it can be done much sooner. There are some things I picked up along the way and resources for being a WGU student. (I took the JAVA route and I started with Software Developer and switched to Software Engineer in Fall of 2023.)\n\n1. First, before diving into course materials, check announcements and course tips. Especially for courses with a PA (performance assessment). I such case there's usually a step by step outline of how to complete all the requirements for the PA.\n\n2. Email your CI (course instructor) for additional resources. Sometimes the course pages aren't up to date with preferred methods.\n\n3. If you're required to get a certification in an area, use official resources for it. I think most of these are provided although the AWS resources were incomplete for Cloud Computing. I suggest using a certification prep course from Udemy.\n\n4. Udemy and LinkedIn learning are FREE to use for anything! Some of the course videos are not very good and I found that Udemy had better and more thorough content. So you can access these by using your WGU credentials. Use the Business version of Udemy called Business Udemy it's a separate platform but has all the courses.  \n\n5. If you're reading this sub-reddit, congratulations! I wish I had used it sooner to find the short cuts for some of the more difficult courses. \n\n6. If you're struggling on a particular class it's probably not your fault.  More than a few of them are poorly structured or have other issues. (I'm looking at you D385!)\n\nMy final thoughts on this program is that it's a convenient way to get your degree (and sooner). I think that having a foundation for understanding the development process is valuable. \n\nHowever, I still need to build up a portfolio. I thought I'd have one ready at the end but I only have my capstone that is portfolio worthy.

{"post_id":"1haqth9","subreddit":"wgu_devs","title":"D278 - Passed in 5 Days ","selftext":"Good evening, friends!\n\n  \nI am here writing about my experience with the course D278: Scripting and Programming Foundations. \n\n  \nQuick Stats:\n\n* How long did it take me? **5 days** total and **19.5 hours** of active work (readings, labs, activities, exam prep, PA, and OA)\n* How long did the PA take me? **31 minutes** \n* How long did the OA take me? **72 minutes**\n\nI started this class already with a bit of coding knowledge, however it was my first time using Coral. By this, I mean I have learned a bit of coding on my own, made a website or two (very amateur) and have watched many videos learning about software engineering and lifestyle. \n\n  \nWhat I appreciated most about this class is it is really good at filling in the gaps between what I already knew and what I should know as a software engineering student. I did not rush this class and I did do all the readings, participation activities, challenges, labs, etc. I also used quizlet to study terminology. \n\n  \nI took the PA this afternoon around 2:30pm and passed with Exemplary. I did maybe 30 minutes of \"brain dumping\" on my iPad everything I could recall from memory before taking my OA this evening at 7:00pm. The OA was significantly more difficult than the PA. I ended up passing with Competent for my OA. The comparison between the PA and OA is quite different and I ended up feeling a lot of anxiety while taking the OA. In my opinion, the PA gave me a false sense of \"exemplary\" when compared to my OA experience. \n\n  \nTo those about to take the OA, some advice: \n\n1. Study and commit to memory all the different functions and use cases (math) for the % operator. There were at least 3 questions where the operator was used and you had to do the math to correctly display the output. \n2. Familiarize yourself with as many examples of the SDLC process. Make sure you can 100%, without a doubt, identify the stage (whether agile or waterfall) given a long list of scenarios. Also be prepared to dissect a scenario and list all the stages that apply\n3. Lots of graphical and pseudocode, so be able to depict those and follow them through\n4. Bookmark every question you are even slightly insecure about and come back at the end. There were several of these that I felt much more confident after a break away from. \n5. Be able to look at a diagram and depict which type of UML diagram it is (structural , activity, class, etc) and WHY...meaning what is the advantage over the others for a given scenario.\n6. Know and be able to explain the differences between compiled and interpreted languages. Know their types and why one is used over the others. Know all their characteristics. Be able to read a scenario and determine which one should be used. Be able to read a scenario and determine if the type listed is correct\/incorrect and why\/what should be used instead. \n\n  \nLastly, my experience with Guardian and proctoring was positive. No issues at all. \n\nBest of luck to anyone about to take this exam and thank you to everyone who has commented on other feeds telling their stories and giving advice! Truly helpful!

Glad to see my time and effort pay off!\n\nThe exam time given is an hour and a half but it only took me 25 mins to get through it (the material was pretty similar to the practice assessment). If you\u2019ve done well in the PA like I did, I wouldn\u2019t worry about the OA too much. It\u2019s not a carbon copy but both have similar questions and tackle the same topics\/themes.\n\nNow that I\u2019m finally done with this class, I can share the study path I used to pass the course.\n\n# Don't rely on the zyBook alone\n\n* **Don\u2019t use the zyBook alone**, that's a mistake! I would highly recommend downloading:\u00a0[A Common Sense Guide to Data Structures & Algorithms.pdf](https:\/\/github.com\/GauravWalia19\/Free-Algorithms-Books\/blob\/main\/Library\/src\/JAVASCRIPT\/A-Common-Sense-Guide-to-Data-Structures-and-Algorithms-Level-Up-Your-Core-Programming-Skills.pdf)\u00a0by Jay Wengrow \u2013 the best comprehensive book I've found for learning data structures & algorithms\n\nTrust me, the zyBook starts going into some advanced concepts way too early and without really bothering to explain those things in a way you can understand. It will just make your head spin.\n\nTake notes as you go through each chapter of Wengrow's book and make sure you understand each topic.\n\n**P.S**: You don\u2019t\u00a0*need*\u00a0to do the coding portions in the book. As long as you understand how the algorithms do what they do at a high-level, you\u2019re good for the test. The OA will not have you coding these things, only interpreting the code and asking you to explain how each algorithm works.\n\n# Watch Youngblood's Cohorts\n\nA lot of people recommended Dr. Youngblood's Cohorts to me during my studying. The man explains the basics of data structures & algorithms pretty well and you get a lot of good value from his videos. He goes through each part of the test with you. You should be able to find his videos in your Additional Resources page on WGU for your class. Look for 'cohorts' under your Additional Resources link (usually under Course Tips).\n\nHere is a link to his cohorts in case you need it (you must be signed in to WGU):\n\nData Structures  \n\\- [https:\/\/wgu.hosted.panopto.com\/Panopto\/Pages\/Viewer.aspx?id=07ce521b-a8f8-4d0b-bfea-b0d000efd756](https:\/\/wgu.hosted.panopto.com\/Panopto\/Pages\/Viewer.aspx?id=07ce521b-a8f8-4d0b-bfea-b0d000efd756)\n\nSorting Algorithms  \n\\- [https:\/\/wgu.hosted.panopto.com\/Panopto\/Pages\/Viewer.aspx?id=70876c5f-5c2c-4612-8e33-b1d1004d6944](https:\/\/wgu.hosted.panopto.com\/Panopto\/Pages\/Viewer.aspx?id=70876c5f-5c2c-4612-8e33-b1d1004d6944)\n\n# Follow the Additional Resources > Study Guide on WGU\n\n* **After getting the C949 study guide from your WGU class page**\u00a0([read this](https:\/\/blog.rickp.dev\/data-structures-algorithms-c949-week-1\/)\u00a0to know what I\u2019m talking about), you are ready to start using the official zyBook\u00a0on WGU.\n   * The main chapters to focus on are:\u00a0**Ch. 1**\u00a0through\u00a0**Ch. 11**\u00a0(inclusive)\n   * If you already know Python, you can skip the Python chapters (12 \u2014 19)\n   * **Ch.**\u00a0**20**\u00a0**& Ch. 21**\u00a0are also important, you need to know about Classes and why they are used, as well as recursion and recursive functions.\n\n# Quizlet Assessment Review\n\nFinally, I **strongly recommend** the following Quizlet assessment:\n\n[https:\/\/quizlet.com\/867759982\/c949-data-structures-and-algorithms-flash-cards\/?i=5wxpbg&x=1jqt](https:\/\/quizlet.com\/867759982\/c949-data-structures-and-algorithms-flash-cards\/?i=5wxpbg&x=1jqt)\n\nAbout 90% of what shows up in the OA is in that practice set. I suggest using the 'Learn' feature on Quizlet with those terms and flashcards to create your own practice quiz. This helped me out a TON when reviewing the material after all the note-taking. When you start getting mostly correct answers on the questions, you can move on to the PA.\n\nI have written an article on my blog that includes a C949 study checklist to use for studying\n\n[https:\/\/blog.rickp.dev\/%e2%9c%85-passed-data-structures-algorithms-c949\/](https:\/\/blog.rickp.dev\/%e2%9c%85-passed-data-structures-algorithms-c949\/)\n\nGood luck and farewell!","permalink":"\/r\/wgu_devs\/comments\/1h55ojp\/passed_data_structures_algorithms_c949_tips\/","created_utc":1733173313,"score":36,"text_length":3140,"vader_compound":0.9975,"course_code":"C949"}

It should really just be called \"Angular\" because the amount of Javascript needed is trivial and not particularly good for getting a solid grasp on Javascript itself. Anyway, I will say the guides I searched here were actually not that helpful and usually refer to older versions of Angular. Newer versions (I used 18, but 19 is set to be released soon) use stand-alone components, which makes setting everything up a lot more streamlined. If you already have a decent understanding of programming in general, I would skip going through all the Javascript modules in the Zybooks and just look up how to do things specific to JS as needed. Also, I would highly recommend NOT using ChatGPT or other LLMs for anything other than simple questions with unambiguous answers, such as downloading the npm\/node and angular CLI. The official angular documentation was the best resource, and it has mini walk-throughs for all the main aspects of the framework. The most difficult part will be setting up the HTTP request which you should be making an actual separate Angular service for and dealing with the data it returns might be a bit tricky at first if you haven't dealt with JSON data but it's kind of like dealing with a dictionary in python. Make sure to click course search and read the guide provided it gives the correct API url to use. The Udemy course they link to is okay but goes over a lot of stuff you just will not need to know for this project, but it would definitely be useful for adding additional features and design elements for your portfolio.","permalink":"\/r\/wgu_devs\/comments\/1gudurn\/d280_passed\/","created_utc":1731959748,"score":14,"text_length":1628,"vader_compound":0.9565,"course_code":"D280"}

Or do they want me to list each step for Task 1 and Task 2 and give a hypothetical timeframe? ... Or is it more like \"Design - 1 Week, Testing - 2 weeks, Building the UX - 3 Weeks, Prototype - 4 weeks\".... ? I'm just wondering how specific they are asking you to be because the instructions just say \"Timeline of the activities in this project\" ...   \n**Wireframe:** There seems to be some confusion in the posts about the wireframe. Should it be more like a sitemap with boxes with lines drawn between them?  Or is it a wireframe of the layout of a page. They're asking for a wireframe that demonstrates the flow of your website....So how do you demonstrate flow using wireframes??

He kept bothering me about my camera, which was ANNOYING AF (because it was throwing my thought process), but I worked with him. \n\nSo as I worked through my test I needed to use the restroom, so I went to talk to the dude, but my Camera is showing a red light (meaning its not in use) so I went back to the guardian browser to see what happened and the dude was gone like as if I completed my test but I wasn't so I went to use the restroom and came back to finish my test and here are my results\n\n[Didnt do that well but a pass is a pass](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/707nx0xdti1e1.png?width=957&format=png&auto=webp&s=d3a7e27650655c0d9b988b2e97ecfbfbbc7617ac)\n\nIts not as good as I wanted but a pass is a pass\n\nso as Im happy for me passing but then I get this email on Saturday\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/7hrewaxeyi1e1.png?width=928&format=png&auto=webp&s=f86d463cab4cee5c22c8d4effa4acbc568ee0095\n\nwhich is false can someone please tell me what I should do.

{"post_id":"1gl3mom","subreddit":"wgu_devs","title":"Passed D280 JavaScript Programming in ~3 hours ","selftext":"I need to put a huge ***\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*DISCLAIMER\\*\\*\\*\\*\\**** at the top of this that I have worked in software development for almost 4 years now. I knew a few frontend frameworks going into this, so learning Angular for the first time wasn't a difficult process. \n\nI have a spreadsheet that I use to track my classes. I include an \"estimated time to pass\" and \"actual time to pass\" column so I can see how I'm doing. My time estimate is typically pulled from what people are saying on reddit. I put my estimate at 2 full weeks for this course because of the horror stories in this sub. And I spent less than 3 hours working on it, and wait 1.5 days for my submission to come back. I'm going to try to explain this, without giving away any code, to try and ease your minds. Hopefully it's approved and not taken down for whatever reason. Apologies for the long post. \n\nOkay so you need to connect to GitLab which can be confusing. Hopefully you've taken Version Control by now and are familiar with running commands in your terminal. I don't like Gitlab personally, but it is what is it. Note that you have to remember to make commits after completing each section. I forgot to do this because I was in the groove of coding and at the end I had to individually stage each file and make like 8 commits before pushing. Total pain, don't be me. Commit after each section. \n\nOnto the actual assignment. Create your Angular project using the CLI. I was confused and thought when I cloned in the GitLab repo, I would be getting a \"prebuilt\" project. So create your angular project in the directory that you forked the GL repo from. Your job is to turn a map interactive. This map is in an SVG. Click the link, and copy the code directly from the browser. If you don't know how to do that, just inspect element and look at the code to copy it. In your new Angular project, create a folder. I used Angular 18.2.11 and since I'm not an Angular expert, Idk what the default file structure looks like, I can't tell you exactly where to put yours. Mine went in my \/app directory. I only created 3 new files for this. An html file, a typescript file (It says Javascript but you'll be learning typescript because Angular), and a css file. ONLY 3 FILES NEED TO BE CREATED. Do not overthink this part. \n\nLooking at this project can be daunting if you have limited to no coding experience, or frontend experience. But you're likely in this program to become a software engineer, so think like a software engineer. Break this project down into smaller easier to solve problems. First, how do you get a map to render? Great, the map shows up. How do you get 1-N number of columns to display your content? Look that up and put placeholder data. Especially if your new to frontend, make a div and put a border: 1px solid red; like the rest of us working on frontend nonsense. Cool, now you have 2 columns side by side. Now how do you make the map interactive? You need to hover right? Look up how to make an element do something when your cursor hovers over it. At this point, it'll likely be the whole map. Say you have the map on the left side, red bordered div on the right side. Can you change the border color of the right div when you hover over the map? Great, you have some functionality there. What does an SVG have? A bunch of paths right? Those paths point to countries. How can you iterate over a collection of information? Great, now you've solved that and can highlight each country when you hover over it. Now for the tricky part, gathering data from the API and displaying the contents. \n\nThis is probably the trickiest part because working with APIs can be a pain. Read the documentation on the API first and foremost. Learning to read, and comprehend documentation will be instrumental to your development career. Practice it now. Look up how to make API calls in Angular (remembering to specify your version of Angular, and the method of calling the API this assignment wants you to use). Practice pull all the data. How do you know you've gathered data? Look up how to handle API calls with logging and handling errors. Once you have the data, you just need to learn\/look up how to pass data between the ts and html files. \n\nThis is an extremely long post and I apologize for that. I've mentored a few engineers in my career, although I'm pretty early on. But these problem solving skills are going to be crucial to your success in this field. I have experience so taking 3ish hours on this class isn't anything impressive. It's probably not that impressive actually and should've taken less time given my experience. If you're new, I don't think you should try to fully speed run this class and finish in a day. But I also don't want you to be stuck in this class for months like some people here have mentioned. It should take probably 15-20 hours with minimal experience. Far less if you have more experience. What you should be taking away from this course is problem solving abilities. You won't become an expert at Angular or typescript from this assignment. This is not a project that's worth putting on your resume or portfolio. It's incredibly simple and would likely be considered a barebones project with basically zero functionality. It's assumed you know how to do stuff like this when you apply for a job. \n\nMy closing advice. For this assignment, and every other assignment you have to do here you should be able to follow this approach until it clicks. Open the assignment, and read through what it is that you need to do. Write it all out on a piece of paper in bullet points. Go through each bullet point and ask yourself what you need to do to solve that. Break it down into 2-3 smaller problems that are easier to manage. If you can break down one big problem into 3 problems, you can solve each problem easily. Each problem solved is momentum and deepens your understanding. Once you've solved all 3, you'll likely have the forth problem of connecting all 3 solutions. But that will only further deepen your understanding. \n\nGood luck with this course everyone, and remember, you're here to (most likely) become a software engineer. Nobody said it would be easy, but you can succeed if you put in the work.

They also asked about different Migration strategies and some other things that the video didn't really cover.

The images around it are all from Google search, showing how different systems kinda work like Elastic Beanstalk. So many of these things have similar names like CloudFront, CloudWatch, CloudFormation. You have ElasticFileSystem, Elastic Load Balancer, Elastic BeanStalk. Diagramming them like this really made me understand the different importance of things, and also how some stuff are basically Pre-Made\/Pre-Configured services such as AWS Athena or AWS Aurora that you basically don't \"create\" like other things, you just tell them to run and they go do their own job. Have a clear understanding on the difference of EC2 Instances, S3 storage, the different Database systems, the different Monitoring systems, and the basic Security services they offer. CloudTrail will always be used for API uses, like seeing WHO does WHAT in your AWS setup. Route53 basically hosts the \"websites\" or whatever people would use to publicly access your apps, and then something like CloudFront will cache the websites so they can access it faster. When I opened my Test, first thing I did was open that whiteboard they give you (which is moreso a text editor, not really to draw on), and I started writing down EVERY single term that was in my head. I infodumped on there and kept going as I took the test, it really helped to just let go of that information and then be able to keep going back to it whenever I got stuck. \n\nIf you spend 10 hours of really good study on this course, you can definitely pass it within two-three days. Not very hard, but definitely a bit overwhelming with the amount of knowledge you need to KNOW. With that Video and W3Schools you can pass this whole thing. Just get it all engrained in your head what does what and the significance between them you'll do fine.

While I did receive a preliminary pass for the exam upon completing it, I was still informed that it could take up to 5 days to get my detailed results. To my surprise, I received my official exam report just only a few hours after taking the exam, and I'm pretty happy with the results. While WGU still needs to process the exam results so it's reflected on my degree plan, this marks the end of D282 for me.\n\nThe only resource I used was the Neal Davis course on Udemy. All it took to pass this class was going through the Neal Davis course a few times, reviewing the course slides and cross referencing them with the exam cram slides, taking thorough notes on Notion and memorizing them through Quizlet, and lots and lots of procrastination. Really not a difficult exam in my opinion. It really boils down to how good you are with memorization and identifying key words, since that's what most of this course is. \n\nAnyways, got five classes left before graduation (and they're all performance assessments, so adios exam anxiety), so I better get on top of that.

{"post_id":"1fc9bk5","subreddit":"wgu_devs","title":"D335 Intro to Python Feedback","selftext":"I absolutely hated this class with a passion and not because I don't want to know python, it's because I hate the resources. I just passed it today, on my second attempt. Posting this to supplement the other posts out there about this class, while those were helpful, hoping to expand on a few things.\n\nFor some context, I am in the BSDA program (data analytics). Prior to taking this class, I had intro to programming (can't remember the exact name) but essentially, its the psuedo language class, then I had to take applications in C++, which is not relevant to data analytics at all. I started this program before they completely changed the requirements. When WGU finally wised up and changed the program to include python (duh) I had to take this class. So anyway, I had a pretty basic understanding of the programming concepts before taking this class, but this class seems to be more intermediate than beginner. I tried following recommendations from other posts here, such as taking the Angela Yu course on Udemy - sort of helpful but not really because that one doesn't cover the files aspect which is somewhat important.\n\nIf you can, highly recommend passing on the first attempt. If you fail and have to redo, your course instructor will send you a stupid study plan to follow before they approve your second attempt (which I had no idea of, this is the first time I have not passed on the first try).  The study plan they gave me for the second attempt WAS NOT HELPFUL in passing the second time, just more work loaded on that I had to do before I could take the test while also focusing on the things I actually needed in order to pass.\n\nThe course instructor made me do a bunch of function labs, but I didn't do one single function on either OA. This wasn't even the area I failed on - so I feel like they send a canned study plan to everyone.\n\nI skipped the CSV question, but brushed up on files. The first OA I took, just needed to append a line to the end of the file. Couldn't remember how to do it in the moment on the first one. The second one, I had to print the second row of the file only. I recommend being able to pass at least one file question, whether it be CSV or the file. The file questions seem way easier. The good news is the labs are way harder than the OA questions I encountered, even in chapter 34. If you can do those easily, the OA questions on these will be a breeze.\n\nThe other hiccups for me the first go were the try\/exception block question, which should be super easy in theory (I did great on those labs, but the OA didn't work the same for whatever reason) and the custom module.\n\nFor the try\/except, you have to raise the exception in your try block to get it to work. You cant just do your if statement in the try block and expect the exception to work (maybe I'm just stupid, but this was what got me the first time and I just couldn't figure it out. I tried doing just an if\/else statement instead just to pass that question with output but it didn't work because of the way they test your output.) They expect an exception to be raised and passed. Instead, I did an if statement in the try block, then else: raise ValueError. Then the except block handled the ValueError and I passed the question.\n\nlike this:\n\ntry:\n\nif input\\_val is in \\[list\\]:\n\nprint(whatever you're supposed to print)\n\nelse:\n\nraise ValueError\n\nexcept ValueError:\n\nprint('Error')\n\nand that worked. Not sure if this is the \"best\" approach, but that is what worked for me.  I agree with other posts, be very comfortable with chapter 34 questions to successfully pass. The text and CSV files on the OA are way easier than what I saw in Chapter 34, and in theory that should help pass, but if you're an overthinker like me, that just causes confusion in coming to a simple answer.\n\nThe OA is 15 questions. You need to get at least 11 correct to pass. The hardest questions for me was the CSV file question. I ran accross this quizlet: [https:\/\/quizlet.com\/872394014\/python-flash-cards\/](https:\/\/quizlet.com\/872394014\/python-flash-cards\/) that helped me a lot, with simpler methods to passing questions (the phone number\/student id question and the custom module). \n\nThis was my outcome:  \n8 questions for comp 1\n\n3 questions for comp 2\n\n4 questions for comp 3\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/c2f7zeghonnd1.png?width=865&format=png&auto=webp&s=7a0a870990978a72961ff7008c1e8a96aadd637b","permalink":"\/r\/wgu_devs\/comments\/1fc9bk5\/d335_intro_to_python_feedback\/","created_utc":1725832223,"score":3,"text_length":4198,"vader_compound":0.9866,"course_code":"D335"}

That was several months ago, so I went into this class pretty much fresh.\n\nI did this while working 40 hours a week and having to go slow for medical reasons. It's possible to do this with ZERO previous experience by studying hard for a week. I chose to be sure I was ready.\n\nThe only reason I mention all that is for people to know you can do it if you... Just Do It\u2122.\n\n**Total Time Studied - \\~25 hours**\n\n**Main Study Method:**\n\nI wrote flashcards by hand for Zybooks Ch. 2\/7\/8 key terms and including the labs. I grinded on these flashcards and a white board every time I had a chance. I rarely write anymore so doing the flashcards by hand and whiteboarding the answers felt much more memorable to me.\n\n**Key Study Materials:**\n\nZybooks - Skimmed and spent more time on things that I had a tougher time with. Main source of practice, DO THE LABS for Ch. 2\/7\/8. I also did the Pre-Assessment twice a day. Once at the beginning of my study sessions and then again when I'm done for the day.\n\n[This Imgur Cheatsheet](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/d427-all-syntax-0Gb8Ddc) covers all the Key Syntax.\n\nMain [D427 Quizlet](https:\/\/quizlet.com\/814403378\/data-management-applications-d427-mysql-sql-programing-intermediate-level-flash-cards\/?funnelUUID=e6d6ae09-862a-437c-bc75-df6d476da442) with most of the Zybooks content.\n\nI was getting confused on JOINs until I found [this picture.](https:\/\/i.sstatic.net\/4zjxm.png)\n\n[Bonus ](https:\/\/onecompiler.com\/challenges\/overview\/42kzxjcmp\/d427-challenge-lythia)that I didn't get to from Discord.\n\n**ProctorU Experience:**\n\nPretty straightforward. My first proctor was loud with a lot of pinging sounds in the background. I was sweating the upcoming distraction but I had to uninstall all screensharing apps on my laptop and restart. When I came back, the new proctor was text chat only and professional. Didn't bother me at all.\n\nThey wanted a 360 of the room, under my desk, and wanted to watch me turn off and put away my phone. That's it.\n\n**Exam:**\n\nTime to complete - 70 minutes\n\nIf the Zybooks labs were a 6.5\/10 in difficulty, then the exam itself was a 5\/10. It was extremely close the the pre-assessment. In fact, I passed the pre-assessment with basically the same score a few hours before the exam. I am pretty sure I missed two questions that felt obscure and MySQL related more so than SQL itself.\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n\nI think I overstudied by 2-3 days. I absolutely recommend getting the fundamentals down, and don't worry too much about what TINYINT vs SMALLINT is like I did.\n\nI feel confident that I got lucky with an easy set of questions, so be prepared! With that being said, if you know your aggregate functions, core syntax, how to create\/alter a table, join differences, how to join, and constraints then you're good to go!\n\n**---**\n\nIf you want to read more on my test-taking strategies or what the AWS proctored exam is like then check [this post](https:\/\/onecompiler.com\/challenges\/overview\/42kzxjcmp\/d427-challenge-lythia) out.","permalink":"\/r\/wgu_devs\/comments\/1enna0x\/data_management_applications_d427_in_10_days\/","created_utc":1723167120,"score":9,"text_length":2665,"vader_compound":0.9948,"course_code":"D427"}

{"post_id":"1eiiyfp","subreddit":"wgu_devs","title":"D277 Finished","selftext":"I just wanted to make a quick post about this class. There are definitely some good reddit posts I've seen about this class in particular but they are more focused on people with less experience. I just want to walk through the basic structure of the class in case anyone wants a quick rundown without getting too into the weeds of it all. \n\nFirst off, this class has 2 PAs so Task 1 and Task 2.   \n  \n***Task 1:*** Very simple task here. All you have to do is make a basic layout of a website. The goal is to get you to \"recreate\" a government website but it doesn't even have to be that in depth. Your mockup needs to include semantic HTML tags so you can just draw the boxes and label them accordingly for things like head, nav, aside, etc.. All I did was use Figma (I've used figma plenty at work before so I was most familiar with this) but you could use anything I'm sure. Canva, miro, even MS Paint would likely work just fine. Make sure to include the actual HTML tag in the box via a text box. I literally just put \"<nav><\/nav>\" in black text in my nav section. Add some differing colors to make sections easier to see and take a screenshot and you're done. \n\n***Task 2:*** Task 2 was also very simple for me. You need to build and deploy a basic website. This include HTML files, a css file, and a javascript file. My site ended up having 5 HTML files, 1 css file, and 1 javascript file. And a handful of jpgs in there. Do not overthink this website. Read the prompt thoroughly and make sure to include any semantic tags they require, as well as exactly what is needed for the javascript file. For deploying the site, they give you a few options to choose from that are all free. I have deployed code via multiple platforms before so I just watched a quick 5 minute youtube video for the hosting platform I chose and it was good. One thing to note, is that you're supposed to make this similar to your mockup from Task 1, but mine looks quite a bit different. I just chose the same colors from my mockup and that was it but everything else looks different. If you have the time I'd recommend using bootstrap or just css flexbox to style it quickly and effectively. \n\nA few things to note about this though. I have a few years experience working as a developer already so none of this was out of my wheelhouse. However, I haven't used vanilla js in awhile so I had to look up a few things. Overall, task 1 took me about 30 minutes to complete and I turned it in. After I turned it in, I started on task 2. Task 2 took me about 1.5 hours to create because I was spending time researching information and finally I just asked AI to gather the specifics I needed so I could quickly reference them. All in all this class took me 2 days to complete. I submitted Task 1, got it back the next day. Immediately submitted Task 2 after I passed Task 1 and then got it back the next day and finished the class. Took 2 days from start to finish but only about 2 hours of work. I'm not sure if this helps anyone out there, but if you have any questions feel free to ask and I can try to help you out.

{"post_id":"1eekygp","subreddit":"wgu_devs","title":"Cloud Foundations D282 Tips","selftext":"Just took the CCP exam today and got a preliminary pass, will get the official in 5 days. Here's what I experienced in a few quick tips:\n\n- The course material is garbage. At best, these Amazon videos are lacking in almost any context or teaching ability, at worst they're bad, outdated information that will cost you points on the test. It's literally just people reading a script that was written like a sales catalogue. Avoid this stuff completely.\n\n- The Udemy courses are fantastic, specifically the \"Ultimate\" course. I wasted a week on the Amazon videos and got some basic info, but scanned through this Udemy course in two days getting only what I thought I was missing. I feel that those two days were the most valuable and I would have been a lot more confident going into the exam if I ONLY did the Udemy course.\n\n- The labs were fine. If you genuinely like the hands-on experience they're nice, but I don't think I learned anything from the labs that helped on the exam.\n\n- The practice exams are, for the most part, significantly more convoluted and difficult than the exam itself.\n\n- The actual exam was half-straightforward and half made from material that was nowhere in the learning materials, Udemy or otherwise. This seems like the testing service trying to scam money from you - it's Pearson, they're shady already.\n\n- Speaking of Pearson, give yourself at least an hour to troubleshoot their testing interface if you're taking the exam online. The app they use is horrendous, and most of the fixes I found online to make it work properly on my MBA involved either third-party software or disabling security controls that I didn't want to mess with. Thankfully I also have a Windows machine, on which the OnVue app was buggy as hell but eventually worked.","permalink":"\/r\/wgu_devs\/comments\/1eekygp\/cloud_foundations_d282_tips\/","created_utc":1722209381,"score":5,"text_length":1814,"vader_compound":0.5131,"course_code":"D282"}

I thought I had it after watching a few videos and the recorded cohort, but after reading the class text it doesn't make sense anymore.\n\nI hope someone can help.

{"post_id":"1eb6iz6","subreddit":"wgu_devs","title":"Passed C952 Computer Architecture: Second Attempt: My Advice To pass","selftext":"**Background:** Failed my first attempt!\n\n\\*\\*(you can skip this part and just read the advice if you do not care to know how I failed my first attempt)\\*\\*\n\n**First Attempt:**\n\n1. I was accelerating through my courses, and THEN I got to this course... I was completely burnt out by the time I started this one and after reading the first chapter, I was done. Took the PA, failed. I spent a few hours skimming the textbook, watched 3 of the Webinar videos on 1.5x, Assembly vid, computation, PA vid. Looking back, I should have put this course to the side and just worked on JAVA Fund. Anyways, didn't even try the PA again, just went ahead and SENT IT. Took the OA, and failed. I was really close to passing(honestly, this had to be A LOT of lucky guesses), the bar was close. This was the final nail in the coffin for me... I didn't touch the material for another 2 months and focused on ITIL 4\/JAVA.\n\n**Requirements to be approved for another attempt:**\n\n1. Instructor made me complete powerpoints for each section on the suggested review. Then I had to present them to 5 different instructor (45min apts each). I think he realized I completely ghosted this course and then tried to jump back in for another OA. So, I get why he required this. I seriously just copy and pasted most of this. I was extremely frustrated with myself at the time lol.\n\n**Second Attempt\/Advice:**\n\n1. After completing said requirements, I really began to dig into the book. Went from hating this course to absolutely loving studying Computer Architecture. The book is dry at points but some chapters are pretty interesting.\n   1. **Read the book (suggested chapters only)**\n      1. I read through all the chapters that were necessary according to the study guide.\n      2. I took my own notes for ONLY the blue highlighted vocabulary.\n   2. **Utilized Chatgpt**\n      1. Anything I couldn't grasp, I would copy and paste it into chatgpt and have it break it down in much more simpler terms. This made all the difference, not just memorizing vocab but understanding it, which is essential for the OA. (it's not just the vocab word then find correct definition 95% of the time on the OA).\n   3. **Watched the Lusby Videos**\n      1. I watched the lusby videos (75% of them) on 1.5x after reading the chapter\/taking notes to see if he pointed anything out that needed special attention. His videos are like a summary.\n   4. **Rewatched PA, Assembly, and Computation Videos**\n      1. Watched these on 1.5x, did skip around a little bit.\n   5. **20 page study-guide\/Computation worksheet\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\***\n      1. After a lot of digging, I was able to find these two docs on an old reddit post. These were amazing and really helped the most, imo.\n      2. Did a few computation problem sets. Used chatgpt to break it down even more for me.\n      3. [https:\/\/ashejim.github.io\/BSCS\/C952.html](https:\/\/ashejim.github.io\/BSCS\/C952.html)\n   6. **Quizlet**\n      1. Randomly throughout the day or in-between reading, I ran through some vocab on quizlet.\n   7. **Took PA again**:\n      1. Passed with ease!\n2. **Second OA: This is a very very high level OA! Don't go too deep into the weeds!**\n   1. Second OA was completely different than the first from what I remembered. only 2-3 computation problems on 2nd OA. (pipelining questions\/CPU Time are freebies if you know the equation).  I only had 1 history related question. (first OA had way more).\n   2. Around 60% was straight vocab, but having an understanding and not just memory is necessary, imo.\n   3. 4-5 Assembly questions. These are pretty straightforward. The participation activities really helped prep for these on the OA.\n   4. Few questions on Virtual Memory. Study that area and the surrounding content.\n   5. 1-2 Hit rate, hit time, miss rate, miss penalty questions. Vocab was key here.\n   6. Few memory hierarchy questions\/ TLB questions, Virtual memory, page table.\n   7. Know Caches and the different Schemes.\n      1. PASSED THE OA WITH A LOT OF ROOM TO SPARE!  FELT EXTREMELY CONFIDENT GOING. EVENTHOUGH THERE WERE SOME ODD BALL QUESTIONS.\n3. Vocab will get you by pretty far in this OA.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nI understand this is a pretty rigorous study plan. I completed all of this with hard study sessions, in 12 days. If you\n\n\\*\\*If you want to just get this class done asap, You may be able to get away with: Memorize quizlet vocab, watch Lusby, Vids on PA, comp, binary, assembly. Maybe do some practice problems, and take the PA to see where you are. \\*\\*\n\nThis may be too much for most people, but I went into the OA and was extremely confident. **I had two interviews for SWE internships shortly after completing this course, and because I knew this material so well, I was able to share about CA and use that to answer some interview questions\/go deeper into the questions regarding performance, cpu, memory, and a little history. They were very impressed.**\n\n**Overall, I came to love this course and so thankful I didn't just run through it too fast, just to pass the OA and move on. Those 12 days were long but worth it!**","permalink":"\/r\/wgu_devs\/comments\/1eb6iz6\/passed_c952_computer_architecture_second_attempt\/","created_utc":1721840360,"score":10,"text_length":4959,"vader_compound":0.9952,"course_code":"C952"}

{"post_id":"1dmth9r","subreddit":"wgu_devs","title":"D308 Mobile Application Development Tips ","selftext":"Task A: What else is there to say other than you know what to do here. You run the pipeline for the Gitlab repository.\n\nNow, you'll need to download Android Studio for this course and there's a webinar for setting it up. You should use Groovy and not Kotlin for the dependencies because it'll make it easier. I suggest you to watch the first Webinar for setting up this project because she'll go through it step by step.\n\nNow, some of you may have a potato PC and android studio is just a memory hog. It's really harsh on low end computers if you try to use the virtual emulator on the computer. I suggest you to use an android device to test out your code. You go to settings > about phone > software information > tap build information 5-6 times and enter your phone's password > click back button to settings page > click developer options > enable USB debugging. Then you'll need to reboot this android phone, so the changes will register to this device. Then you can plugin your cell phone and you'll see it on the device manager which can be accessed from the button on the right hand side of the screen. You'll get a popup once you plugin your android device and you need to allow your computer to have access to your phone's data for this to work. Then it'll run fine without any issues whatsoever. This is just a tip for those who are running low end computers. If you got a really good gaming PC or a high end PC, then you can just use the virtual emulator without any issues. \n\nTask B and C: Now, the project in the webinar is a bicycle products and parts shop essentially. It's like D287, but it's done on a mobile app. But you're going to be developing one with vacations and excursions instead. The products category is your vacations category and the parts category is your excursions category. You just follow through with the webinar. However, you're going to be using a hotel name rather than a price. You just need a string for the hotel name rather than a double to display the price. The source code for the project is available under gitlab course templates and you can find it under D308. But I still recommend you to watch the webinar series because you'll be using files you probably never used before if this is your first time. You're not only using Java classes. I recommend you to set the playback speed to 2x and you'll get it done much faster that way. \n\nNow if you decided to copy her code all the way after watching the webinars, I suggest you to eventually replace price with hotel. You'll have to remove price from the excursion\\_details xml file from the layout tag. You'll also have to completely delete price from excursion details and you'll see the errors after you delete the variables you declared at the top of the code. It'll just make it easier for you to delete this. You'll have to delete price from the entity files and remove it from the constructor as well. Be sure to replace price with hotel for the Vacation entity and Vacation adapter files. Then you'll also need to edit out VacationDetails and VacationList to replace price with hotel. And finally you'll have to edit the version number of the AppDatabase to a different number. You may have an error from an DAO Impl file which is a file that runs in the background, but all you have to do is delete price from there. Then your project should function normally again if you built your android app using price instead of hotel initially. \n\nNote: You may run into an issue where your code seems to perfectly match everything from the webinar code and there's no issues with it whatsoever at all. Chances are your code is perfectly fine if it mirrors everything from the webinar code. If your vacations are not being displayed on vacation list, then it's most likely due to an issue with your xml layout for the vacation list page and you just need to fix it, so that it will be displayed. If the issue is with your excursions not displayed in the vacation details page, then it's because you're using outdated data. The vacationID doesn't match any of the vacation IDs for your vacations. And you'll need to clear the database which can be done programmatically. First you'll want to go to view which is at the top of the page and go to -> tool windows -> app inspection. Then run your app and click on the welcome page to enter into the vacation list page. Click on app inspection which is located in the icons at the bottom left of your page alongside logcat, terminal, etc. You should be able to view your database to check if the problem is due to outdated data before you clear the database. I have sample code that you can use to clear the database and keep in mind that this code is only for clearing the database programmatically. Clear database code [here](https:\/\/pastebin.com\/PTdTWXjq). \n\nNow I also added the start and end dates to the database as well through the entity class for my vacation details. I did the same thing with my excursion details page where I added the date to the database through the entity class. That's how I managed to get my dates to work and update when the user saves changes to the vacation or excursion if you watched my demonstration of the app. You'll also have to edit the Vacation List class, Vacation and Excursion Adapter, Vacation Details, AppDatabase by changing the database version number, and the DAO\\_Impl files. Just keep that in mind if you're going down this route and doing what I did. ChatGPT can help you out with the DAO\\_Impl files and just tell it that you added something new to the database and show it the entity class with the changes and show it the complete DAO\\_Impl file as well. It'll help you out with this one because that's what I did. The changes I implemented using ChatGPT helped me get my app to work properly. \n\nThe date validation was placed inside of the vacationSave and excursionSave if statements you will implement into your VacationDetails and ExcursionDetails classes. Here, it won't let you save a vacation if the end date is before the start date when you write the code for it and the same thing will happen for excursions where the set date won't go before the start date nor go after the end date. This is to just help you receive a hint with validation and you can easily do this using a try statement. \n\nWatching the first 4 webinars will help you build your mobile app for the most part. But it's not everything as you need to do a signed APK which is in another webinar found in the webinar list page. \n\nYou'll need to add a delete excursion option on the toolbar for the excursion details app page. This will be similar to adding in an excursion, but you essentially do the opposite with deleting it. You'll need to add a start and end date for your vacation details. Your vacation details page should include the ability to set an alert and to share it with others. The course instructor shows you how to do it with the excursion details page. But you need to put this into your vacation details page. As for the excursion details page, you'll just need the alert and you'll need to implement validation which prevents it from being created before or after the start and end dates. You'll also need to implement validation for your vacation details page by not allowing the end date to be set before the start date as validation. Just keep that in mind when you're working on this as a reminder to fulfill the rubric requirements.  \n\nSome of you may be wondering about a demonstration of the app because there isn't a specific webinar dedicated to just demonstrating the android app. I created a simple demonstration myself if you're wondering which includes most of it with the exception of sharing details as I was using my personal android device and not a virtual emulator. The link to the video is right [here](https:\/\/www.dropbox.com\/scl\/fi\/7idd6h2w96fkmo8k3xw92\/Vacations-app-demo.mp4?rlkey=nrtyvbcg35e72yv43c2x34wbn&st=6zqk6exr&dl=0). \n\nTask D: You can use Canva and create a simple storyboard using their website. It's free and simplistic for you to use. You just create screenshots of the UI from the home page to every screen that exists on your android app. Just use the whiteboard as your design and export it as png. That's how you'll pass this storyboard section.\n\nTask E: Just follow the webinar for the signed APK and the course instructor shows you everything she screenshots in that webinar. Just follow what she did and you'll be completely fine here. And if you're wondering about the android version, I just used my physical device as my emulator and you can find the android version under the settings -> about phone -> software information. You can also use the logcat and it should tell you the android version of your device at the top left corner next to the filters tab. This part is incredibly simplistic and shouldn't take much time. \n\nTask F: Just be sure to include everything in the [README.md](http:\/\/README.md) file that is listed in the rubric. You're essentially submitting a storyboard file, a copy of your git branch history, the screenshots for your signed APK with the files included in your project, a filled out README file inside of your project, and the git repository URL from your Gitlab repository.","permalink":"\/r\/wgu_devs\/comments\/1dmth9r\/d308_mobile_application_development_tips\/","created_utc":1719169291,"score":13,"text_length":9085,"vader_compound":0.9988,"course_code":"D287"}

It consisted of six activities:\n\n1. **Plan**: Developing a shared understanding of the goals and aligning strategies.\n2. **Improve**: Continuously enhancing services and processes based on feedback.\n3. **Engage**: Understanding stakeholder needs and ensuring their involvement.\n4. **Design & Transition**: Creating and implementing new or changed services.\n5. **Obtain\/Build**: Sourcing and developing necessary components.\n6. **Deliver & Support**: Ensuring services are delivered and supported effectively.\n\n# Chapter 6: Putting ITIL into Practice\n\n**Incident Management**\n\nTech Haven implemented a structured process for handling incidents:\n\n* **Logging**: Every incident was logged in a centralized system.\n* **Categorizing**: Incidents were categorized based on their nature and urgency.\n* **Prioritizing**: Prioritization ensured that critical issues were addressed first.\n* **Resolution and Recovery**: The team followed a standardized process for resolving incidents efficiently.\n* **Closure and Evaluation**: Once resolved, incidents were reviewed to prevent recurrence and improve future handling.\n\n**Service Request Management**\n\nFor service requests, they established clear procedures:\n\n* **Standardization**: Common requests, like password resets, were standardized to streamline the process.\n* **Tracking**: Each request was tracked to ensure timely resolution.\n* **Communication**: Regular updates were provided to requesters, improving transparency and satisfaction.\n\n# Chapter 7: Continuous Improvement - The Magic Ingredient\n\n**Continual Improvement**\n\nAlex introduced the concept of a Continual Improvement Register (CIR):\n\n* **Idea Collection**: Team members were encouraged to suggest improvements.\n* **Evaluation**: Ideas were evaluated based on their potential impact and feasibility.\n* **Implementation**: Selected improvements were implemented in small, iterative steps.\n* **Review**: Regular reviews ensured the effectiveness of the improvements.\n\n# Chapter 8: The Transformation\n\nAs these practices took root, Tech Haven experienced a remarkable transformation:\n\n* **Efficiency**: Incident and request handling became more efficient.\n* **Satisfaction**: Employee satisfaction improved due to better service and communication.\n* **Team Morale**: The IT team felt more organized and less stressed, boosting morale and productivity.\n* **Reputation**: The IT department gained a reputation for reliability and excellence within the company.\n\n# Chapter 9: The Legacy\n\nTech Haven\u2019s success story inspired other departments and companies. The principles and practices of ITIL 4 proved to be timeless, adaptable, and powerful tools for any organization aiming to improve its IT service management.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nIncorporating ITIL 4 principles transformed Tech Haven from a place of chaos to a model of efficiency and excellence. By focusing on value, fostering collaboration, and committing to continual improvement, the IT team not only enhanced their services but also became a vital part of the company\u2019s success.\n\n\n\n","permalink":"\/r\/wgu_devs\/comments\/1dcwnrq\/understand_business_of_it_applications_d336_wgu\/","created_utc":1718053679,"score":2,"text_length":6801,"vader_compound":0.9998,"course_code":"D336"}

I can link them in the comments if you guys need, but Reddit and Google really carried me through this one. \n\nAll in all, you can likely finish this class in 2-3 days, just outline the PA so you know what you need to work on. It took me like three weeks since I would get frustrated and put off watching the video, and sitting down to just work on it. The 1 hour video they give you is somewhat helpful, I think it gets you through the first two parts, but you stil need to use the GitLab How-To at the bottom of the PA. I would say go that right after you outline the PA, just follow that link and you knockout the first two parts. I don't like that the video is in Github and you work in Gitlab, to me that caused unnecessary confusion. I didn't even watch the last half of the video series, I skipped all the parts that are little \"how-to's\" because you don't really need them.\n\nI hate how hard it is to find information and links from WGU on this course specifically. I had to go through as many Reddit posts until one linked to a master page that has around 12 links, which has the Template (that you're supposed to us) on it. I couldn't access that page anywhere else other than Reddit, i'm really not sure how you're supposed to find it on the Course page. I would say watch the first portion of the video they give you and then watch [this video](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=DVRQoVRzMIY). Between that video and Googling what you don't understand you can grind your way through this project. For instance, tagging isn't even specified in the video they give you, you genuinely have to go look that up yourself.  \n\nI rate this course a 4\/10. It is somewhat \"straightforward\" but you're very much on your own. The issue isn't about how easy\/hard the project is, just how little information they give you themselves. If they included that second video I linked, then you could get through probably 60% of the project. Even just adding some reading material for Tagging, Merge Conflicts, adding Directory would get you everything you need. If people want, I can try to add a more thorough guide in comments or if you guys need help I can try.

{"post_id":"1c9pwnq","subreddit":"wgu_devs","title":"D287 Java Frameworks Tips ","selftext":"You can follow the directions in the course search page for opening up the repository containing all of the project files for you to use. I recommend you to download it as a zip file and for you to extract all of these files into a folder of your choice. Once you have done that, then you should open up the project files using IntelliJ Ultimate. Once your project folder is opened by the IDE, then you must click on the main menu button and click on file on the top left corner. Then click on project structure and set the SDK to Java 17. (Note: If you don't have that option, then you must download Java 17 on their website). Then you can configure the settings for the Java application using the word document. Just be sure to click on the src and main dropdown button and click on the Java file and then you'll configure the build application settings. It'll automatically locate the demo application file once you have done this.\n\nI recommend you to click on the course search button and click on additional resources to view the cohorts. The webinar is called \"overview of the performance assessment\" and it shows you what the website should look like and how it should function as demonstrated by the course instructor. Then you'll receive a greater understanding of what you should be doing when it comes to building this web application. You can also view the other webinars to help you understand concepts such as MVC which is incorporated into Java Spring Boot. There are also videos on Youtube that explains MVC if you'd need additional help to understand it. ChatGPT can also help you understand the concept of MVC as well. You should really understand what this project is about before you start working on it even further in my opinion. The link below is meant to help build your understanding of how the Spring Boot framework works. So you can understand the purpose behind different files such as controllers, repositories, and services for example. Understanding all of this should help you out in the long run.\n\nSpring Boot YT Tutorial: [https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Nv2DERaMx-4](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Nv2DERaMx-4)\n\nD287 Java Frameworks Ultimate Guide: [https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/WGU\\_CompSci\/comments\/15mocjz\/d287\\_java\\_frameworks\\_ultimate\\_project\\_guide\/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web2x&context=3](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/WGU_CompSci\/comments\/15mocjz\/d287_java_frameworks_ultimate_project_guide\/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\nD287 Java Frameworks Highlight: [https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/WGU\/comments\/18550iu\/d287\\_java\\_frameworks\/](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/WGU\/comments\/18550iu\/d287_java_frameworks\/)\n\nThe first four sections shouldn't take much time. Section D might appear to be difficult, but you just really need to create a new class with a controller and map the about us page you created for this task. Also to make sure that you template the about page exactly like the other html pages mapped on the mainscreen.html page. Even section D shouldn't take you long once you understand how to create a controller and use it. You can examine the other controller files to help build your understanding of it too. But it should be really simplistic since you don't need to add any additional logic to the controller for the about page.\n\nSection E isn't bad at all because you just have to use the commented out code on the BootStrap file to create your parts and products. I recommend you to use an if statement with the count() method for the partRepository and productRepository to prevent duplication from occurring. Otherwise, your code will keep duplicating itself every time you run the web application. The code should be inside of the if statement to prevent duplication just so you know. This section shouldn't take long for you to complete either. I think you'll be able to get this done quickly once you understand what you must do.\n\nSection F can easily be done if you were to create two html files displaying a separate message. One for a successful purchase when inventory is greater than 0 and one for a failed purchase when the inventory is equal to 0. You will be creating a controller for the buy button that you'll be creating which is next to the update and delete button the mainscreen html file. Make sure to use the annotations for making the controller. You'll need [](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/user\/Controller\/) and [](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/user\/GetMapping\/) like you did with Task D. Basically you must implement the logic of the code on this controller. You will need to get the productID using the [](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/user\/RequestParam\/) in the parameter of the public string function you'll be using. And you need to use the if statement logic to determine whether the inventory has 1 or more items placed inside of it. I'd suggest you to use the D287 Java Frameworks Guide I linked because it'll help you complete the task faster. It won't take you long once you understand what he's telling you to do for Task F.\n\nTask G can be tricky since you have to do quite a few things. The D287 Java Frameworks guide outlines what you must be doing and that part is very straightforward. However I want to add a few things. You should add two new columns to the parts table and you should add the data for the newly added columns to the parts table. You should comment out all of your code for Task G before you run the web application because you'll run into an error. You must delete all of the sample parts and products and anything you may have added that wasn't part of the sample. Otherwise, the code won't work as the new items you added to the database will essentially be null. And the logic written in the controller files should be located inside of the [](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/user\/PostMapping\/) function. You can't have two functions using [](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/user\/PostMapping\/). I just used an else if statement after the if statement to make the code work properly.\n\nTask H builds up on Task G. They want you to create error specific messages, so if the inventory is greater than the max inventory, then it should tell you that the inventory you entered is greater than the max inventory and vice versa. Now the bulletpoint stating that there needs to be an error message if the inventory is less than the minimum inventory is clarified in the Task H demonstration of the webinars. It's a short video demonstrating this specific point, so that you'll understand it much better. I recommend for you to follow the D287 Java Frameworks guide for this because I did exactly that and I passed the course without any issues.\n\nTask I is incredibly easy because you just have to make the unit tests exactly like the ones done for the inventory. There already exists code for the other unit tests. You can just use that to make your unit test for it. The webinar also has a lecture on unit testing to help you out with that.\n\nTask J is also very easy because you just have to delete any unused validators. IntelliJ will tell you how many usages the validator has. You're probably just going to delete one validator as I have done that.\n\nOverall, this course wasn't so bad and you could definitely complete it much faster with the guides that are out there. You could also watch the Spring Boot tutorial to help further build your understanding of this framework before you start working on it. It requires you to learn and understand what the files exist. And you also have ChatGPT to help explain the code to you, so that you'll understand what you're reading. I think the D287 Java Frameworks guide will be sufficient for you to work with.","permalink":"\/r\/wgu_devs\/comments\/1c9pwnq\/d287_java_frameworks_tips\/","created_utc":1713726550,"score":12,"text_length":6916,"vader_compound":0.9986,"course_code":"D287"}

It was extremely dry but I read through it.\n\nAfter, I used the study guides that were given through the Course Search and answered all of the questions for both of those study guides there. I used a mixture of the textbook (using Command+F or Ctrl+F to search for keywords in the text to the question I needed answering), the reddit posts below, and ChatGPT for the answers. I wrote down the answers to both of those so I don't have the answers typed up.\n\nI feel like I used ChatGPT a lot in this course, and that was mainly to simplify whatever it was I needed to understand the material. A lot of the material is convoluted, so I needed to dumb down the explanations a bit (lol)\n\nThen I searched reddit for additional info or any additional study guides (since it seemed like what I was learning in the study guides was not very accurate to what would be on the test). \n\nThese posts helped me the most:\n\n[https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/WGU\/comments\/196mvcs\/passed\\_d386\\_hardware\\_and\\_operating\\_systems\\_first\/](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/WGU\/comments\/196mvcs\/passed_d386_hardware_and_operating_systems_first\/)\n\n* I reviewed the Google Doc and used some of the answers there for some of the questions on the Course Search study guide as well.\n* I watched the entire Youtube playlist and that gave a very basic view of the subjects that are covered and helped me to understand the core functionalities of each subject.\n\n[https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wgu\\_devs\/comments\/15zbroy\/d386\\_hardware\\_and\\_os\\_master\\_study\\_guide\/](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wgu_devs\/comments\/15zbroy\/d386_hardware_and_os_master_study_guide\/)\n\n* THIS ONE. This post helped me the most, read the comments as well because there is a lot additional information there as well.\n* Based off of the bullets of this post, I made my own study guide: [https:\/\/docs.google.com\/document\/d\/107aLLwChZgSUU\\_fMNcLntGRCS\\_zA3LoEQVvIV4A5u8I\/edit?usp=sharing](https:\/\/docs.google.com\/document\/d\/107aLLwChZgSUU_fMNcLntGRCS_zA3LoEQVvIV4A5u8I\/edit?usp=sharing)\n* The first reddit post they pasted also helped, you could use those bullets to add to your own study guide as well. My study guide did not include those bullet points.\n* The google doc in this one also helped me with the course search study guides i made.\n\nOverall, the course has A LOT of material, and it took me what felt like forever to finish. There were a few questions on the test that I had never seen in any material that I reviewed. \n\nAlso, (this is personal preference) I didn't add any Quizlets because I personally can not learn that way, but in the posts above they definitely had some they listed as well as practice tests.\n\nIf you have any questions, comments, or concerns, feel free to let me know.

{"post_id":"1c00lwd","subreddit":"wgu_devs","title":"Software I \u2013 C# - C968 - Help Needed","selftext":"Hey everybody.\n\nLongtime lurker and occasional commenter here.  \nI've just started C968 and I'm looking to get some study tips from those who have already passed.\n\nI am completely new to software development, save for the classes I have already taken that are relevant, such as Programming and Scripting, Advanced Data Management, or Data Structures and Algorithms (all of them have carryover in some way for me).\n\nIf you are like me, you have read other reddit posts, as well as through the PA, and are absolutely stunned with confusion, to the point where you have no idea where to begin other than the textbook itself, hoping and praying that you learn enough through the textbook to eventually piece together what you need for the PA.\n\nAs with many classes, I have seen the \"just youtube it\" and \"textbook is too vague, use X instead\" sentiments expressed for this class as well.  The class has you jump around a textbook that builds on and references itself, so you are left feeling out-of-the-loop much of the time (for example, I start in chapter 4, but that chapter has half a dozen or so \"in chapter 3 we talked about this\" type of paragraphs)  \nI incredibly green to this type of work (as stated above) and would like to pass this class with a solid understanding of what I just did. Point being, I'd like to learn the fundamentals but also save myself the headache of trying to understand the textbook. Sure, I could piece together the PA via youtube videos, but I fear that would result in me knowing how to pass the PA as opposed to knowing the basics of C#, if that makes sense.\n\nI am currently working through the course material and frankly, it all makes sense- it just takes awhile to wrap my head around it. I exit each section of the textbook thinking, \"I understand this, but It could have been explained better\". I'm content with jumping around the textbook and composing my own notes. I'm sure in time I will pass just the same, but I cannot help but think that I can save myself a ton of time with an external resource, much like I did with Data Structures and Algorithms, or Hardware and Operating System Essentials).\n\nPer this [comment](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/WGU\/comments\/d38mw1\/comment\/f028z92\/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), I am trusting that the material provides what I need, but I cannot help but assume that there exists a udemy course (or something similar) that will save me tons of time, because that has been the case for so many other classes I have already passed (insert comment about how googling things is a relevant and valuable skill I need once I get into the software dev workforce).\n\nI guess my goal in writing this post is to ask (for myself and any future students) if anybody has a reccomendation to a udemy \/ linked-in course that parallels the info in the textbook. The class resources link has external links to udemy, pluralsight, and linked-in, but no specific courses. They just link to the website home pages. I'm sure I could search around and find something, but I'm guessing it would take just as long to find the right resource (and use it) as it would to simply work through the textbook.\n\nI've stumbled across (for example) [this Udemy course](https:\/\/wgu.udemy.com\/course\/csharp-tutorial-for-beginners\/) as well as [this Udemy course](https:\/\/wgu.udemy.com\/course\/csharp-intermediate-classes-interfaces-and-oop\/) that seem to build on each other. Surely \\~10 hours of videos streamlined into googling around for my PA will be faster, right?\n\nAll of this to say, if you have some helpful tips, please do share them below. Thanks!\n\nEDIT: I spoke with my dad, who's worked as an embedded software engineer for years. He said that, in general, a highly-recommended video course will be far more efficient and just as useful as a textbook. Since I've seen that to be true in my previous courses at WGU, I'm taking the leap as the guinea pig with the Udemy courses I linked above. I'll report back my experience in due time.\n\nEDIT 2: I completed both linked Udemy courses this week, and had a phone call with my CI. Turn's out my CI (Harlan Brewer) used to be Mosh Hamedani's teaching assistant. Small world. Anyway, both udemy courses (12ish hours of videos), according to my CI, are enough before starting the PA. The course material will serve as supplemental references as I work on the PA. Will update after I hand in my assignment.\n\nEDIT 3: I just finished my PA. Waiting a day before I look it over for small errors, then I will submit. As someone who is completely new to c#, I cannot stress this enough: UNDERSTAND METHODS, CLASSES, AND INHERITANCE before starting the PA. and watch a couple beginner guides to Windows Forms (I didn't but I wish I did). Also, the udemy courses I linked above are worth watching, but they are exponentially more valuable if you complete the provided practice problems. Do them. They are worth it, and will save you much heartache on your PA. After my Project submission passes I will return to share what worked best for me, and how I would do the class differently if I had to start all over again.\n\nEDIT 4: Finally passed. I had to resubmit the first time due to a couple small boo-boos in my methods. I worked on this for maybe 5 or so hours across the last couple weeks as revisions were needed. Make sure to test your form through all cases prior to submission :).\n\nEDIT 5: As I started studying for software II (it was my next class) I quickly realized I didn't have a solid enough grasp of the basics of c#. I'm working through [Krystyna \u015alusarczyk](https:\/\/wgu.udemy.com\/user\/krystyna-slusarczyk\/)'s Ultimate C# Masterclass for 2024 and have to say: If you are trying to make a career out of C# (like I am), I highly recommend going through this course in its entirety. I'm skipping the end-of-section assignments but doing the code exercises, personally. If I had the time, I would also do the assignments.\n\nEDIT 6: Quite possibly the last edit I will make to this post. I've just started my PA for software II (which means I finished [Krystyna \u015alusarczyk](https:\/\/wgu.udemy.com\/user\/krystyna-slusarczyk\/)'s Ultimate C# Masterclass for 2024 in it's entirety). Some parts of the udemy course are not needed for either class but will prove helpful in time for future c# work in my career. I could ramble on for awhile but the bottom line I can give is this :  \nIf you are after a career in c#, do Krystyna's full udemy course, assignments and coding exercises in all, and you will be more than prepared for C968 and beyond.  \nIf you are not after a career in c#, do Mosh Hamedani's beginner and intermediate courses in their entirety, and you should be setup quite well for C968.\n\nEDIT 7: Here after submitting my project for Software II. It's a slog but keep pushing and you will work through it. The better you understand data structures the easier this class will be. \n\nIf I had to do this all over again, here's what I would do:  \nStep 1. Option A (if you are a big reader): Go through the required course material readings and take extensive notes. Focus on methods \/ classes \/ inheritance, but you want to make sure you can tie everything together.  \nStep 1 Option B: (If you are a hands-on learner): watch all Udemy Courses linked above, take your time, do all practice problems provided. Again, focus on methods \/ classes \/ inheritance. Embrace the struggle of learning things step by step NOW so you don't get confused later on.  \nStep 2.  Watch a couple youtube videos on windows forms.  \nStep 3. Leverage Form Inheritance for your project. Meaning, create a base form (form 1) that holds common methods, etc. and let the rest of your required forms\/cs files be children\/inheritants of that form.  \nStep 4. If you are new to writing C# code, this class can be a STRUGGLE. Biggest way to overcome that is by breaking up the learning 1 step at a time. Pre schedule out 60minute sessions with your CI so you can get their help via webex. In general, CIs are very helpful \\*if you can actually get their time\\*, so pre plan.","permalink":"\/r\/wgu_devs\/comments\/1c00lwd\/software_i_c_c968_help_needed\/","created_utc":1712690316,"score":13,"text_length":7635,"vader_compound":0.999,"course_code":"C968"}

No revisions needed, passed on first attempt. \n\nMy background: ZERO experience with Git\/GitLab.\n\n* What I did: \n   * I started by watching programming with Mosh: \"Git tutorial for Beginners: Learn Git in 1 hour.\" Just to get familiar with the BASIC terms and operations. \n   * I started to watch the LinkedIn learning videos provided by the course (if you are really struggling these will walk you through step by step). My ADHD would not allow me to sit for so long without doing anything.

I used my MAC terminal paired with VSCode. VSCode made things so much easier.

Here's the speed run of what worked so hopefully you don't have to struggle too.\n\nI used InfinityFree, the other sites were either sketchy or broken and the instructor insisted that InfinityFree was a valid option. The site says it can take up to 72 hours to get the domain running on all browsers so you'll want to get it ready to go before you're done with the rest of the project if you're running short on time.\n\nHere's the step-by-step.\n\n1. Create your account and choose a domain.\n2. Navigate to the file manager. There are a few ways to get there, they all lead to the same place.\n3. The file manager is really buggy, so be patient. There will already be a few files in there. Leave those alone. To into the \"htdocs\" folder, this is where you'll upload your files. Inside that folder is an index HTML file (I'm guessing so if you follow the link to your new site there's something that will load so you can see if it's working). This index file can be deleted.\n4. I couldn't upload my whole project folder, in zip format or otherwise. It either refused to load or would say it loaded but nothing was in there. I had to upload every single file individually.\n5. Your main HTML file HAS to be named index.html, or the site won't load because it doesn't know what file to use first (learned that the hard way). Also, links within your HTML pages (both to other pages and to images) are case-sensitive.\n6. That should be all you have to do. To check the site, go to the nav bar at the top of the main InfinityFree site and go to Accounts>Domains and use the link to your domain. If the domain is ready for your browser (I read somewhere about clearing caches to speed it up but didn't try it) then once you hit that link your website should load immediately.","permalink":"\/r\/wgu_devs\/comments\/1bssxpl\/hosting_the_web_site_for_wgu_frontend_web\/","created_utc":1711940483,"score":15,"text_length":1940,"vader_compound":0.6144,"course_code":"D277"}

{"post_id":"1bmcn2k","subreddit":"wgu_devs","title":"This might help you pass D335 Intro to programming in python","selftext":"To start here is what my scoring was on my first and only attempt. I will explain why I intentionally didn't get 2 questions correct below.\n\nI studied \\~one week.\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/olxax040m7qc1.png?width=854&format=png&auto=webp&s=98829022321fc29c7de0e44141d4909a23113cc9\n\nFirst off, the only things I used where the zybooks course and chatgpt very very minimally.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've seen posts of people saying how hard this course is and how you can't learn it with zybooks and that is just not the case. Are there better ways to learn out there? Probably. But this does just fine for this exam.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI haven't seen many posts that are actually helpful so here is my attempt at helping.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHow quick this goes will really depend on how well versed you are with programming, if you are a \"never programmed in python or really anything for that matter\" like me then you could expect to get this done in around a week or two like me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe first thing I did was just start going through the course like normal. I did most of chapters 2 and 3 and figured I might as well look at the zybooks practice tests.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI started doing those and they were much easier than I thought they would be. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, this is the key: when I got to a question I couldn't answer, I would try to answer it to the best of my ability and when I got stuck I would consult the relevant chapter in zybooks in another window and use what I was learning to adjust my code real time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe best way you are going to learn is by doing. It also really helps for the tests because they are the exact same format as the final exam questions. the only difference being is there is no \"submit mode\" on the test and you will have to see if everything is correct on your own.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf I really got stuck on a question I would consult chatgpt  but that happened maybe twice and chatgpt wasn't really all that helpful.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe practice test 2 in zybooks is basically the final exam. There are some differences but if you can answer all the questions in the practice test 2 without any help then you should be able to answer the final exam.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, why did I intentionally not answer two of the questions? because I honestly didn't have time or want to take the time to learn how to read, write, and change files. I tried but couldn't understand it. My term ends next week and I still have another class to finish so I couldn't take the time to learn it. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut all of the questions I did answer I got 100% on.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBasically, if you can do all of the practice test questions and learn them and why they work you will be fine and it will really help you know what you need to study and what isn't critical to your passing the class.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow for my test taking tips:\n\n1 - Make sure your output matches the example EXACTLY. \n\n\\- if you have an extra space or forget a dollar sign you will get the ENTIRE question wrong. even if you write a t instead of T. has to match exactly just like in the practice test\n\n2 - the test only grades you on the output. If your output is correct every time then your code doesn't have to be perfectly what the question might be asking. Get creative because there is more than one way to solve a problem.\n\n3 - if you have a hard time remembering something, some format or term or whatever, when you start your test quickly write everything down that you can remember. Whether it be on your whiteboard or in one of the test submission boxes\n\n4 - take your time. You have more than enough time to complete it. 4 hours to be exact. slow down, do it right.\n\n5 - if you get stuck on a question move on because a lot of the questions have similar parts to them and one question might help you answer another\n\n6 - take extra time to go back and test every single output again. Check the formatting is correct, that you are getting the right answer, that the right conditions are running.\n\n7 - read the whole question a few times. some questions can be a little confusting.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat's it. If I could start over I would probably just start with the practice test within zybooks and learn and answer as I go.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nComment any questions and I will come back and answer what I can! \n\n&#x200B;\n\nGood luck!","permalink":"\/r\/wgu_devs\/comments\/1bmcn2k\/this_might_help_you_pass_d335_intro_to\/","created_utc":1711255833,"score":32,"text_length":4200,"vader_compound":0.9973,"course_code":"D335"}

{"post_id":"1b01vdz","subreddit":"wgu_devs","title":"Passed D280 in 1 week, thoughts + tips and tricks","selftext":"Howdy Night Owls!  \n\n\nI recently passed D280 this past week and wanted to share some tips that I think might prove useful for those of you who are struggling with this class or are stuck.   \n\n\nI started by referencing the following reddit post to get started:  \n[https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wgu\\_devs\/comments\/14tk5u8\/ultimate\\_guide\\_to\\_javascript\\_programming\\_d280\/](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wgu_devs\/comments\/14tk5u8\/ultimate_guide_to_javascript_programming_d280\/)  \n\n\n**Important to Note**: The first comment in the thread indicates newer versions of Angular (V14 +) not creating the app.module.ts as well as importing new components. I found this information to be critical in ensuring my project ran correctly.  \n   \n**Also important to Note:** When creating the app in cmd, I was asking about enabling server side rendering. I found that enabling this actually caused a lot of problems with my project and was causing a \"document is not defined error\". I googled this and found the following link which suggested disabling server side rendering: [https:\/\/www.decodingweb.dev\/how-to-solve-referenceerror-document-is-not-defined#how-to-fix](https:\/\/www.decodingweb.dev\/how-to-solve-referenceerror-document-is-not-defined#how-to-fix)  \n\n\nLastly, I browsed Github by searching for the class number \"D280\" and reviewed several other projects to see what portions of my project I still need to fill in to ensure it would work correctly. I filtered results by the highest rated and found that the only code I actually needed to write was in my world.component.ts file after the code that Angular already generated for me in that file after creating the world component. This would allow for the functionality regarding clicking highlighted countries, and gathering associated data from the worldbank API to the corresponding HTML element.  \nMy advice would be to review other projects on Github under D280 and see how other students have implemented that portion of the project if you need help on figuring out how to write the code to round out the world.component.ts file.  \n\n\nOnce I had that and the necessary data in the world.component.html file, I hit \"ng serve\" in cmd under project directory and went to the url and sure enough it was working as intended. Personally from everything I have read so far I was surprised I was able to get it so quickly, so I read through the rubric  to ensure I wasn't missing anything and found I wasn't. I then zipped up my project folder and submitted for evaluation.  \n\n\nAll in all this class took me 2 days of trial and error work, and 3 days to grade. I can understand why this class is challenging to folks that are new to programming in general but I would sincerely encourage to try and look at this in a optimistic way. As the aforementioned reddit post had said \"*what makes this PA so annoying is angular, if it wasn't for the angular framework you could do this class in an afternoon, if you have already used angular before and know javascript, you could do this class in 2 hours*\" - that last portion about it taking 2 hours if you know what to do had me saving myself from overthinking this project and trying to find the path of least resistance on figuring out the solution, keeping that in mind is what I think was my key to getting those done in the time I did.   \n\n\nI do agree that Angular is probably not a great framework to give to students who don't have a lot of experience. And it could certainly be a distraction from the fact that frameworks are great tools that can help auto generate a large portion of applications and make development much easier. But I also live by the sentiment that if it was easy then everyone would do it, and our future opportunities in whatever IT\/Tech job we pursue would not be as prestigious. But take that idea as you will. I hope my notes here are able to assist you with you project and learning in some way! I'll try my best to answer any comments\/questions as I can (time permitting and all)  \n\n\nBest of luck!

I would highly recommend doing this class **first and as soon as possible**, as task 2 has a peer review component. \n\nEssentially what happens is that you have to give 3 peer reviews with usability testing + qualitative feedback, and you will also receive 3 reviews in return which you need to complete the task. \n\nThe rubric criteria for SECTION D states:  \n*\"The summary of the feedback received in the user-testing video files for the candidate\u2019s prototype includes the feedback received in response to\u00a0each\u00a0of the submitted usability tasks and correctly specifies which feedback is or is not actionable.\"*\n\nThe problem with this is that if the feedback \/ reviews that you get back is unusable, then you have to wait to get new usable reviews. Evaluators will punt your submission if you did not get the actionable feedback. This can cost you more time, as you have to do a resubmission for the peer reviews request again, and hope that the student reviewing your work is competent. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* I would also recommend when you submit your usability task questions, write a generic statement such as **\"Do you have any feedback in terms of how the information is communicated or placed in the prototype?\"**  to actually draw out usable feedback from the peer reviews. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSide Rant:  \nI think this is a broken system, and the fact that it is not your competency, but other student's competency will dictate whether or not you finish the class is just nonsense. If in a hypothetical scenario where if this was the final class a student had to complete before term ends, and if they are not able to complete this in time and this extends a term, that can lead to extra costs for students.

{"post_id":"1aotehn","subreddit":"wgu_devs","title":"How I passed Project Management - D324 (Quickly)","selftext":"I just finished Project Management - D324 which is the Project+ certification from Comptia. I studied for this class 2 weeks and REALLY studied 2 days. \n\nThis is not me recommending how you should do it, I am simply telling you what I did because maybe it could help you. I'm not asking for feedback either because I'm done with that class and I'm never looking back. \n\nBut this is how I did it without taking any notes.\n\n1. **CBT Nuggets:** The first thing I did was watch the CBT nuggets course. I didn't really get as much value from that as I could have and that's my fault. I didn't take notes, I put the videos on 2x and mostly just sat there. But since the course was free for only one week I dedicated a week to just watching the videos. When I say watching, I was very passively watching and was on my phone often. But some things definitely did stick. \n2. **Schedule the exam:** After that week of CBT Nuggets, I did nothing for a week and a half. I didn't even log in. But I was motivated to get this class done, especially before the SuperBowl. That's when I decided I was going to schedule my exam. So on Thursday I went in and scheduled my exam for Sunday at 2:00.\n   1. This was probably the best thing I did. I scheduled it Thursday night so naturally I did no studying and when to bed. I woke up Friday, went to my full time job and then when I was done  I started the Certmaster course.\n3. **My CertMaster Process:** The first thing I did was take the practice test. I scored a 53%. Not great, but I started just going through the course and reading things as fast as I could and taking a little more time on the things I didn't understand.\n   1. I didn't really pay much attention to the PBQs. Those were honestly more difficult than what they were worth. I based most of my progress on how things were going with the little quizzes.\n   2. Friday night I got through the 5th lesson. My brain was a little fried, but I took some Zinc, Omega 3s and Magnesium before bed (good for brain health and relaxation, as verified by ChatGPT4) and slept for 8 hours just about. \n      1. Note: While studying I used the Pomodorro technique with 45 minutes of hard work and 15 minutes (usually 30 minutes) of a break which I used to take my dog out and purposefully tried not to look at my phone. When you completely rest your mind more stuff sticks (supposedly) so I didn't want to spend time on my phone looking at social medias and just taking up brain space.\n   3. Saturday I started off the morning with a good plan. The plan was to wake up, spend 4-6 finishing the course material, look over where I was lacking from the practice test and re-study those sections and then study the \"outdated\" study guide. None of that happened.\n      1. What really happened was I didn't finish the rest of the course the whole day. I took a practice test in the morning to see how things were going and got a 56%. Which was a waste of time because it took me 1.5 hrs to do the test and I should have just spent that time learning.\n      2. I got through lesson 13 of the certmaster course and was feeling alright. I went to bed taking the same supplements +creatine and a multivitamin (per chatGPT 4) and slept 8 hours. \n   4. Sunday morning I went to my church at 9:00 am. I forgot to mention but from Thursday to Friday I did a 24 hour dry fast (for religious purposes). I do think that helped me.\n      1. After church I got home around 11:30 and finished section 14 of CertMaster.  I only had about an hour and a half before my test at this point so I went to the latest practice test and started going through the questions in the \"review\" section, paying extra close attention to the ones I missed and to the ones I still didn't know. Luckily the practice test gives really good notes on why the correct answer is correct and why the other answers are not correct. I used that.\n4. **Taking the Exam:** Before taking the exam I took Omega-3, Creatine, Zinc and Magnesium and a multivitamin. Another thing I did was drink some electrolytes and open up a \"Bang\" energy drink. Caffeine can help with short term memory so I drank that slowly in the hour leading up to the test. You may not care about what I ate and so forth, but just letting you know. \n   1. I started my test 30 minutes early and just went for it. It was different than the practice tests but I liked it a lot better. Some notes on why it was different:\n      1. I never got a \"Choose all that apply\" question. What I did get were \"Choose the best **2** answers\" which made it easier. I never got a question where I had to choose more than 2.\n      2. There was only one PBQ style question on the test but it was a lot easier with a diagram and I didn't have to fill out any info or use a calculator or remember equations. \n      3. Most of the questions were single select questions.\n5. **I passed:** I wasn't sure if they were going to tell me right away if I passed but they did and I'm glad they did because I could enjoy the SuperBowl in peace.\n\nThat's basically it. That is how I did it and I don't care if you do it that way or if you think that's the wrong way because it worked for me and I'm not telling anyone to do it that way. That being said here are some tips I wish I would have gotten at the beginning of the course:\n\n* If you are short on time, don't take more than one practice exam. \n* Go through the whole CertMaster course before taking the Practice exam.\n* If you are going to do CBT nuggets, do the whole CertMaster course first. \n* Don't bother with the videos within the CertMaster Course\n* Use your scores on the Practice Exam to know exactly which areas to study\n* Use the notes on each question of the practice exam to study, you will learn what things are and what they aren't\n* You can pass this class within 2 days but you really do have to dedicate the time to learning. This is not a course you can \"get lucky\" on.\n\nIf you have questions, feel free to ask. I'll answer what I can. To be honest this is a cool class because you do get a recognized cert out of it.

For any of you stuck, I hope you feel encouraged by this post that you will see the light at the end of tunnel if you just keep going. I came in with very little experience in software (I did a FreeCodeCamp Front End Beginner's tutorial lol) Under a year I will have completed this degree and I'm stoked to be done.\n\nI worked 3 different jobs through the summer along with doing school so I think I could have gone faster. I dropped one of those jobs when October came so that's why my speed went up so drastically. I can't recommend more highly for you to get an internship (1\/3 jobs) while taking this degree, I think the internship gave me so much insight and learning into what I was doing in my classes so I think if you can manage to find one it will be huge for you.\n\nMy suggestion for finding an internship is to ask startup owners to give you 15 minutes of their time on a phone call or a 20 minute coffee meet. I got coffee with my internship's boss and he offered me a job on the spot simply because I showed tenacity and excitement around the field (I barely knew HTML & CSS). I know this an exception but if you have strong soft-skills I really recommend this approach.\n\nI am also considering holding a Google Meet to connect with some of you other students at WGU or Alum to help with some of your classes like D308 or D288 and form connections for our future careers. I think networking is huge and that's been one of my only negatives about this program, so I would love to connect with anyone willing! Maybe we could discuss something in the thread if anyone would like.","permalink":"\/r\/wgu_devs\/comments\/1am4wdp\/getting_my_confetti_soon\/","created_utc":1707422912,"score":27,"text_length":1726,"vader_compound":0.989,"course_code":"D288"}
{"post_id":"1ajzq9k","subreddit":"wgu_devs","title":"D385 Software Security And Testing Tips To Pass This Course ASAP","selftext":"I have taken the Software Security and Testing course and it's one where the provided material won't help you pass this course. I recommend that you use the PA as well as the quizlets to help you study and pass this assessment. The OA is essentially a carbon copy of the PA just as they have done it with the Python course and other courses as well. I think it's pointless to read through the material unless you seek to learn something from this course. If you're trying to speedrun it and get it done as fast as possible, then it's just better to study the PA and the Quizlets I'll be providing to you. I studied the quizlets to help me understand the key terms that were on this exam as well as memorizing the code that was used in the PA. I passed this course first try by doing so. \n\nAs far as the coding portion goes, you should memorize the entire code snippet because some of the questions require you to work on a different portion of the code snippet. But there are also questions where the solution for the code snippets on the PA are the very same questions you'll answer, but with different variables put in place. Most of the coding questions had different variables put in place and they were the exact same question and solution as the PA. But some of them require you to work on other portions of the code snippet which is why I encourage you to memorize the entire code snippet and how it works essentially. The quizlet for the PA will provide you with all of the solutions that are on there. I suggest you to memorize these coding questions well because that's how you'll increase your chances of passing this OA. You have less code to write in this OA than the Python OA. \n\nAs far as the multiple choice questions go, some of the questions on the PA were also the same questions on the OA. I'd recommend you to learn some of them from there, but not all of them will be from the PA. It's best to use the quizlets to help you memorize and learn key terms that will be on there. Just make sure you know about cross-site scripting, defensive coding, log injection, SQL injection, CORS, and so forth. For questions that you don't know the answer to, I suggest that you use process of elimination which can be done because there are usually 2 or even 3 answers that are obviously wrong. Take your time with these questions you are unsure about and work with process of elimination.\n\nBe sure to read the reddit post I have linked below because the thread contains very useful information you wouldn't want to miss out on.

If you struggle to learn the material from this course using Zybooks, then I suggest you to use a few different sources. They supply you with a book called \"A Common Sense Guide to Data Structures and Algorithms...\" which simplifies understanding the process of Big-O notation. You can find this under the course search materials. You can also watch Bro Code's video on Data Structures and it does use Java, but it's simplistic enough for you to understand and read if you have coding experience already. He essentially covers a lot of material that exists on this exam and I'd suggest you to watch his video. Michael Sambol has made a lot of short videos regarding data structures that you can check out if you need last minute study or just want to get a basic overview of what the algorithm is about. I also recommend you guys to use the Quizlets available to use because it can help you memorize key concepts about data structures and algorithms. I'd suggest you to use this because it will help you understand data structures more easily because some course material can overcomplicate the subject when it doesn't have to be overly complicated to begin with. \n\nOverall, I'll say that this course wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be. You definitely need to know certain things for this OA and this is what I'll be recommending to you, so it should be easier for you to pass this course because you know what to study for. As for what you should study for on the exam, I recommend that you understand the following:\n\n\\-Stacks\n\n\\-Queues\n\n\\-Bags\n\n\\-Lists\/Arrays\n\n\\-Linked lists\n\n\\-Dictionaries\n\n\\-Binary trees\n\n\\-Max and min heaps\n\n\\-Tree Traversal: pre-order, in-order, and post-order\n\n\\-Graphs\n\n\\-Adjacency List\n\n\\-Adjacency Matrix\n\n\\-Pop(), Push(), Remove(), Enumerate(), Enqueue, Dequeue\n\n\\-Big O Notation\n\n\\-Binary Search\n\n\\-Linear Search\n\n\\-Sorting algorithms such as merge, insertion, selection, bubble, heap, etc.\n\n\\-Hash tables and how hashing works\n\n\\-Hash table collision\n\n\\-Recursion\n\nBro Code's video: [https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=CBYHwZcbD-s](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=CBYHwZcbD-s)\n\nMichael Sambol short video playlist: [https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=xli\\_FI7CuzA&list=RDCMUCzDJwLWoYCUQowF\\_nG3m5OQ&index=3](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=xli_FI7CuzA&list=RDCMUCzDJwLWoYCUQowF_nG3m5OQ&index=3)\n\n[https:\/\/quizlet.com\/601971956\/wgu-c949-data-structures-and-algorithms-flash-cards\/](https:\/\/quizlet.com\/601971956\/wgu-c949-data-structures-and-algorithms-flash-cards\/)\n\n[https:\/\/quizlet.com\/558200654\/wgu-c949-data-structures-and-algorithms-flash-cards\/](https:\/\/quizlet.com\/558200654\/wgu-c949-data-structures-and-algorithms-flash-cards\/)\n\n[https:\/\/quizlet.com\/549482417\/c949-data-structures-and-algorithms-preassessment-multiple-choice-flash-cards\/](https:\/\/quizlet.com\/549482417\/c949-data-structures-and-algorithms-preassessment-multiple-choice-flash-cards\/)\n\n[https:\/\/quizlet.com\/620098994\/c949-data-structures-and-algorithms-i-c949-wgu-flash-cards\/](https:\/\/quizlet.com\/620098994\/c949-data-structures-and-algorithms-i-c949-wgu-flash-cards\/)\n\n[https:\/\/quizlet.com\/507208522\/wgu-c949-study-guide-flash-cards\/](https:\/\/quizlet.com\/507208522\/wgu-c949-study-guide-flash-cards\/)\n\n[https:\/\/quizlet.com\/862497094\/c949-wgu-terminology-flash-cards\/](https:\/\/quizlet.com\/862497094\/c949-wgu-terminology-flash-cards\/)\n\n&#x200B;","permalink":"\/r\/wgu_devs\/comments\/1923fde\/i_passed_c949_data_structures_and_algorithms_tips\/","created_utc":1704766958,"score":36,"text_length":2210,"vader_compound":0.9821,"course_code":"C949"}

Although, CCP has a lot of new terms, in quite honesty the exam is very straightforward compared to the practice exams, no tricky words. You just need to pay attention to what\u2019s being asked and choose the right answer accordingly, on very few questions I had a doubt if the answer could be one or the other. It did take me 4 weeks as I messed up the scheduling twice, and had to cancel the appointment. So, just a heads up, you can only reschedule twice, after that you need to cancel and wait for the refund, which can take 7-10 days. I was waiting for the refund until I told assessment services to just mark my first attempt as no show and give me the second attempt with the approval of my instructor who promptly approved. Otherwise, in 2-3 weeks it\u2019s doable to get this done, English is not my first language and I\u2019m not the best learner, so I really need to spend extra time to get myself to study too lol\n\nIn my opinion, use the AWS Skills Builder Cloud Foundation videos, they supplement the material with the examples of a cafe, which make you understand a lot better how the services work, it really did stick with me. \nI Initially used Neal Davis\u2019s videos and spent a week on it, but very few concepts sticked with me so I instead relied on AWS Skills Builder and skipped the last  5-6 sections of Neal\u2019s course.\nI used Stephane Marek\u2019s practice exams, I was scoring 40% maximum 60%.

{"post_id":"187y8in","subreddit":"wgu_devs","title":"I passed D284 Software Engineering","selftext":"This course wasn't so bad, but I have a few tips to keep you aware of what could cause you to revise your PA. You can definitely get this course done within a day and it shouldn't take long to complete this course. You will have access to a template for the PA as well as a Word document outlining background information related to the PA. You can definitely speedrun this course because it's essentially developing a software development proposal for a gaming company. You are not writing any code for this course. You are tasked with developing a CRM system and the Word document will outline the requirements for the development of this CRM and the problems the company is currently facing.\n\nThe first 3 sections should be self-explanatory because it's just asking you to write the intro, purpose, goals, etc. But the prerequisites section is the one you have to look out for. It asks you to write down some prerequisites needed before the CRM system is developed. But it doesn't specify that you need two technical prerequisites on the rubric. You are required to write down two technical prerequisites for this project and these technical prerequisites can't be ones that are already part of the project naturally. It has to be two technical prerequisites that are not naturally part of the implementation of the CRM system. Just keep that in mind before you start writing down the prerequisites for this section. What I mean by \"naturally\" is that the prerequisite can't already be one that's already given due to the nature of the project.\n\nThe rest of the sections are self-explanatory up to the design of the software solution. It asks you to create a workflow diagram for the system process. Basically it can be anything specific like how a certain feature might work. For example, how a customer might use the CRM to purchase a product. That's essentially what they want you to do when creating a workflow diagram. Now there are websites out there that can generate a template for it which is what I did. I used Canva to create the workflow diagram process because it had a few templates for it. Make sure that the two diagrams presented are different. You can't have two flow charts for example, otherwise your PA will be returned for revision.\n\nThe next section is the testing section. You just need to make sure you're not vague with the testing section. Keep it as specific as possible when it comes to the testing process of it. And make sure that the steps for testing are clear and repeatable.

{"post_id":"18067ig","subreddit":"wgu_devs","title":"I passed D335 Intro to Programming in Python course","selftext":"This course has been difficult for many people in the past, but they have apparently revised this course and made it easier. You have 15 programming questions to answer which will be similar to the preassessment and Practice 34 questions. Now the OA will say 16, but the 16th isn't a question. It's just outlining what you need to do for the exam. I think Zybooks is a terrible resource to learn Python, but it's essential to use Zybooks for practicing the labs on there because you will know what to expect when taking the assessment. I recommend you to go to Angela Yu's 100 days of Python course on Udemy and do the first 17 sections of the course. You don't need all 100 sections because you don't have to deal with GUIs, APIs, Web development, etc. It's simply about the basics of python and nothing too advanced. She's much better at teaching you how to code in Python as opposed to Zybooks teaching you how to code. \n\nNow it's important to practice the labs on the Zybooks course material after learning how to code in Python from Angela's course because you will develop a habit of writing code exactly the way they want you to write it in. Whitespaces will mark your code incorrect and it's important that you make sure that you don't have any whitespaces. They want your output to match exactly the same output they set for you in the question example. That's where some people tend to go wrong and make errors because of it. But if you remain cautious about whitespaces, then it should flow more smoothly for you. \n\n**Just to make it clear, you don't need to learn how to write code in Python using Zybooks. But you certainly need to practice writing Python code using the Zybooks labs, so that you know what outputs are expected when it comes to the OA. This is what I did where I just learned how to write code in Python using Angela's course, and then I practiced writing Python code using Zybooks. Learning how to write code in Python from Zybooks is unnecessary in my opinion. Your program needs to match the exact output in the lab question.** \n\nI recommend that you practice Chapter 34 questions on the Zybooks course material because it's the same questions you will find on the preassessment. And these questions will be very similar to the questions you find on the main assessment. That's why it's best to continually keep practicing it until you get it right. You will remember how to solve the questions more effectively through repetition. So that's where you will need Zybooks material mainly for the labs and not for the content that's inside of Zybooks. \n\nYou're allowed to run your code and test it to see if it matches the exact output that they're looking for. You just insert the numbers or words in the input section and then click run once your code is ready to be tested. So you can use it to help you out with debugging your code if any issues arise from testing it. You can also use the help() function in Python to help you remember about certain things. That's the closest thing you will get to having access to documentation on this exam. \n\nI recommend sharpening up your skills with lists, dictionaries, if statements, basic math, try block, converting data types like int to string, for loops, len(), and modulus. Know how to select items from a list because it will help you out with this exam as well as writing user input strings onto a text file. The preassessment and chapter 34 are replicas of the actual assessment with slight variations to it. But most of the questions are essentially the same overall with only a few questions that are slightly different. \n\nI will say that taking this course wasn't so bad, but you should study for what is needed and not for what isn't needed. Apparently they have changed this course a few times and there's been newer versions of this course. I will say that this course isn't that difficult, but it is more difficult than Data Management Applications where you have to write SQL code for the questions. The material for Chapter 34 outlines the material that you need to know and you can ask ChatGPT to help you out with some of the questions if you don't know the answers to them. It has helped me out and I was able to answer the questions just fine with it. \n\nAngela Yu's Python course: [https:\/\/wgu.udemy.com\/course\/100-days-of-code\/](https:\/\/wgu.udemy.com\/course\/100-days-of-code\/)","permalink":"\/r\/wgu_devs\/comments\/18067ig\/i_passed_d335_intro_to_programming_in_python\/","created_utc":1700533587,"score":18,"text_length":4333,"vader_compound":0.9958,"course_code":"D335"}

{"post_id":"1joykpg","subreddit":"wguaccounting","title":"C237 Taxation 1: How to Pass","selftext":"This course **took me 2 weeks to complete,** but it can easily be done in **1 week or 4ish days** if you are rushing. I was just lazy and couldn't get myself to sit and focus on the material. I've seen people on here and the Facebook group say they completed this course in 2-3 days. If you have some knowledge about taxes or can retain a lot of new information quickly, then that could be doable for you. Personally, its a shit ton of info and after a while every word was tax and I was losing my mind lol. I think 1 week is a sweet spot if you have zero knowledge and are going at a very slow pace.\n\n**HOW TO PASS!!!!**\n\n1. Don't even look at the book, just watch the elin recorded cohorts. There are 6 cohorts, and the cover all the material you need to know to pass the PA and OA.\n2. Cohorts 1\/2\/3, are pretty much the bulk of the info. Warning: these cohorts are long af, and because the info was new to me, I really had to take my time and take notes on the slides. I usually like to watch the cohorts at 1.75 or 2x speed, but for this course, I was switching back from 1.25 and 1.5x, just so I would understand want Elin was saying and write down my notes.\n3. Watching the cohorts and writing notes on the slide took up the majority of the time spent in this class. Cohorts 1-3 are between 1- 1.5 hours. So if the cohort was 1 hour, it would take me almost 2-2.5 hours of watching\/stopping to take notes. Cohorts 4\/5 and 6 are shorter and much faster to get through I was watching them at 2x speed bc those cohorts are just review info you already know from the first 3, with a little new info sprinkled in.\n\n**TIPS:** Slowly go through the cohort and learn the material before going on to the next cohort. They all build off each other, and if you don't know what they are talking about, you end up wasting more time having to go back and rewatch\/read the slides. This is how I would pace myself, if wanted to take my sweet old time doing it, if not you can do **two cohorts a day and get done faster.**\n\n**Day 1:**  Watch cohort 1, take notes, study the material, do the supplement question for the cohort( 10 questions). If you can pass those questions move on to the next cohort\n\n**Day 2:** Watch cohort 2, take notes, study the material, do the supplement question for the cohort( 10 questions).\n\n**Day 3:** Watch cohort 3, take notes, study the material, do the supplement question for the cohort( 10 questions).\n\n**Day 4:** Watch cohort 4\/5\/6, take notes, study the material, do the supplement question for the cohort( 10 questions).\n\n**Day 5 :** Review all notes and watch the comprehensive review cohort. This will give you and ideas about the questions on the PA\/OA and how to do the problems with the charts.\n\n**Day 6:**  Take the PA. to me the PA and the OA aligned well. The OA was worded harder but nothing too crazy. REVIEW THE PA, the problems on the PA are the same kind of problems on the OA.\n\n**Day 7:**  TAKE THE OA!!! if you pass the supplement questions\/PA\/and were able to under how to answer the questions on comprehensive review you should EASILY PASS.\n\nThe material is not at all difficult its just a lot of new info that you have to learn and memorize. Elin cohorts tell you what charts will be given and what numbers\/ info you need to memorize. how to find Cap gains\/cap losses, filing status, tax liability, for agi vs from agi, tax authority, 7 itemized deductions, credits and their amount. these are thinks I can remember from the OA\n\n\n\nBEST OF LUCK!!!\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/5volfa0gk8se1.png?width=856&format=png&auto=webp&s=c89e858dc46273e79d4fb7522ae4a662bd109ff2","permalink":"\/r\/wguaccounting\/comments\/1joykpg\/c237_taxation_1_how_to_pass\/","created_utc":1743521708,"score":39,"text_length":3520,"vader_compound":0.9741,"course_code":"C237"}

I googled a lot of the other stuff (e.g., advantages and disadvantages of accepting\/rejecting \u201cX\u201d unethical situation). \n\nI then went through the Grammarly suggested corrections and edited stuff. Then I made sure everything adhered to\/fulfilled the rubric criteria. All in all, I spent about 8.5 hours on this course across 5 days. You can definitely finish it quicker than that; I just had some personal stuff going on that delayed me a bit. \n\nI submitted both tasks at the same time and got them evaluated within 2.5 days.

So, the only thing I would do is to take this with a grain of salt. Your experience may differ from mine so don't be so hard on yourselves.\n*  **Do not depend on the cohorts.** If you're someone like me, you'd rather watch a video than read the textbook, but in this course the cohorts are strictly review and don't have all the info you need to complete this OA. There's a lot of information, such as terms and equations, that you need. Also, there are module videos that explain things to you so please watch those. Just watch the cohorts as it is intended; as a review. \n* **Do the Assignments.** In technicality, you don't need to do them, you really should. They test your knowledge and give you a better understanding of the information. What I did to prepare myself was to do all the Lesson, Module, and Unit assessments was to do them til I got a 100%. It does help you go a long way.\n* **Don't be shy and use external sources.** It's ok to use YouTube, Quizlet, Brainly, and other resources to help you study. There are a lot of Quizlets of the PA out there and a lot of Youtube videos that explain things in simple and detailed terms (I watch Tony Bell's Financial and Managerial videos while I was reading the textbook. Don't worry about terms that you don't see in the textbook)\n* **Talk to your Course Instructor.** They are there to help you, don't be scared to ask for help.\n* **Learn how to use excel.** There are videos and practice in your Course Search.\n\n  \nWell that's all I have to say for now.

My understanding is beginning work-in-process is some leftover work from previous period. So, if we have 8,000 units, direct materials is 0% done so we still need to complete 8,000 units. Similarly, conversion cost is 80% done (6400 units), so we still need to complete 20% (1600 units). What exactly do the direct materials cost ($1600) and conversion cost ($2400) represent? Is it the cost of completing the remaining 8000 and 1600 units respectively, or was it the cost of the 0 and 6400 equivalent units? ChatGPT says it's the cost of what was already completed, so $2400 was the cost of completing 6400 units, so the remaining 1600 units would be multiplied by $1.45 to get 2320. It says $1.45 x 6400 is wrong for the cost transferred out.

Brain is fried and can't fix the title :(\n\nYa'll - I don't think I have posted about any of my actual test results but this one course has gotten to me in so many ways. Some background - I did 21 courses in 3 months and this one took me a month (mostly due to life things and my new Tax Internship) but I was so nervous for this and it wasn't nearly as bad as I thought it was going to be. I honestly figured I'd crush the Liabilities and Depreciation units and decided that if I got 1\/2 right in Stockholder's Equity would be sufficient to pass, so I am super shocked to see I got that whole section right!\n\nTo go through what I did:\n\nI read through the book twice. The first time, I barely understood any of it so I pivoted to just the formulas. I wrote them down over and over again to the point that I wrote them on my whiteboard but didn't really need them at at all. Once I felt like I had those down, I read through the book a 2nd time and took my time with each section. After each unit, I did all the Q&As 2 times for Unit 4 & 5 and Unit 6 once as everything I read was that it was more \"conceptual\" than math based (true!). If there was a question I still was iffy on, I reviewed that once more. I also recorded a OA2 \"Are you ready?\" (or whatever it is called) cohort and went through that on my own time. Today, I did the PA and also went back and did all the lesson, module, and unit tests (both A&B) and if I got one wrong, I read over why. I used my white board to practice and study and I used it religiously on the test. Even on non-JE questions, I was constantly writing out JEs as it helped confirm I was thinking of discount\/premium\/loss\/gain\/etc. calcs correctly.\n\nI found the test to be actually much easier than most of the practice questions provided and many questions to be very straightforward but if I would of used what was practiced on the Practice Questions, I would have gotten them wrong (especially on interest questions) as they were not asking for anything special or that even really required calculations. I don't really feel bad about the extra studying in the sense of wasting time as it was beneficial for my internship and I think will benefit me in D105, but I do not like how long this one took me and then I could have spent more time with my kids the past couple days.\n\n4 classes left and 51 days left for me!

They also consider how the changes may affect suppliers or distributors and ripple up or down the supply chain.\n\nTouchstone 3: Redesign a Job (60 points): Students will demonstrate an understanding of job design by rewriting a job description to better indicate the factors of job satisfaction and engagement and draw more applicants. They will write an explanation that describes the changes they made to the job description and how they align with concepts in job design.\n\nTouchstone 4: Write a Quality Improvement Plan (QIP) (100 points): Students will complete a set of operations recommendations for a manufacturing company. Students will recommend ways to better coordinate with the supply chain in both procurement and distribution, suggest manufacturing and\/or quality improvement methods to improve efficiencies, and suggest ways to improve employee engagement.

But I passed on the first go and I thought I would share what I did and what I learned to hopefully help someone prepping to take this class\/text. \n\nWatch Elin's videos! I know everyone says that but she is really easy to listen to and follow. I watched the video on each unit, followed it up with the reading and answering all the questions on the walk-thru guides, before moving on to the next unit. When I was done with all units, I went back and watched the Practice Question videos for the area I felt weakest in. These videos are long but Elin provides a lot of very helpful information so they are worth it! There is no way I would have confidently answered some of those questions on the OA if it had not been for watching those practice question videos. She doesn't just give you a question and answer, she explains *why* something is the answer, breaks down key component's of complex or lengthy questions (which you will need to be able to do for the OA!) and for some questions will give you examples of how the scenario might be different to make a different answer true. \n\nDo not dismiss the tip of using your whiteboard, taking your time, and eliminating answers! The OA questions are worded to confuse and trick you. Take your time reading them. Write down the key components on your whiteboard that you need to focus on. Write down a letter to correspond with each answer and cross off the ones you know for a fact are not the right one. There will be questions that give multiple answers that appear right, but the key to the right one is who or what the questions is asking about. For example, there is a question along the lines of \"how a member-managed differs from a manager-managed LLC\" The answers include \"all members participate\" and \"Non-members manage\". The key here is the question is specifically asking how a *member-managed* differs. That was a relatively easy one I remembered but it is definitely not the only question that will try to trick you into clicking the wrong answer if you don't pay close attention to who the question is about. \n\nThe only area I did not meet competency in was the area where I did not finish the walk-thru questions or get a chance to watch the whole practice question video because I scheduled my OA before doing both of those and ran out of time. I was confident enough on the other sections and desperate to be done with the class and took a chance. \n\nOverall this course took me 4 weeks to complete, but due to work and commute time I only get about 1-2 hours of study in per night Mon-Fri. Also I have unmedicated ADHD and my ADHD and this class were practically enemies. \n\nFeel free to ask me any questions you may have. :) \n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/ef8v4sdaz1he1.png?width=723&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc7dc5d29472337b98e5e2849f3496a4c1e6bc2c\n\n","permalink":"\/r\/wguaccounting\/comments\/1iha9l9\/passed_d216_business_law\/","created_utc":1738645826,"score":23,"text_length":2790,"vader_compound":0.9875,"course_code":"D216"}

They will ask you a question about a brand getting weakened the answer to that is trademark diluation. The will ask you a question about a patent and the answer is non- obvious.  \n\nKnow you LLC material inside out because they asked at least 5 questions on that.  They asked about a corporation that was taxed once they answer is a corp. they asked what a  corporation  is that operates in its home state and another state. \n\nFor agency: they asked what is it when a principal terminates the agreement with the agent the answer is revocation and then the opposite Nd the answer for that is renunciation ( these questions are back to back) \n\nThey asked about a tow company relationship with an insurance company an - the answer is independent contractor and the insurance company is not liable. They asked another question about a delivery company for a company and the answer to that is independent contractor non -agency relationship.  \n\nThe last section was pretty straight forward: they asked what document to give to investors when bringing a security to market the answer is prospectus. They will also ask about SOX on a few questions so know that the internal controls have to be signed off by the CEO AND CFO, they ask about the ethics of a company and be sure to remember the tone comes down from the top ( board of directors). They also ask when a security can\u2019t be sold( I\u2019m not sure if I got this one right so look it up yourself) \n\nI can\u2019t remember much about the legal environment so just know that inside out because it\u2019s 16%.

It was not easy! But it was doable. I am transitioning into accounting from the tech field. I had 0 accounting experience before I began this program. I passed this exam by a hair. \n\nI did not read any of the text in D216. I only watched Elin Meyer's videos. Only some of her videos are offered in the Course Resources. But if you email her, she will send you a Word doc with links to ALL her videos for this class. I would estimate that it's around 10 hours' worth of videos, maybe slightly more. She has videos that cover all the material in the class, and then has videos of some recorded cohort sessions she's done. These review videos REALLY helped firm up some of the concepts in my head. She picks out some questions from the PA, plus some fresh questions that she whipped up herself, then walks you through how to solve them: how to think about them, how to choose the right answer, and why the right answer is the right answer. It's so helpful. Elin also has such an incredible delivery, she has a way of teaching that matches my brain's style of learning, and I think a lot of other students feel similarly about her. \n\nI watched all her videos, and then re-watched the review ones and the ones that covered my weaker concepts at 1.5x.  I took notes through all of the videos, and I highlighted any concepts that were unclear to me so that I could look them up externally or in the textbook. The highlights would also be a great starting point for if I had failed the OA and had to meet with an instructor. I took the PA twice - once was after I had only watched 1 of Elin's videos (I failed) and then again after I finished all her videos (I passed). \n\nOverall, I'd say I spent about 20 hours on the class, maybe a little more than that.

Also, there was one question on 2nd OA that said how does the lessor record the payment received from the lessee and only one answer had the option to debit cash lmao so like obviously get that one right.\n\n  \nOh and something good to remember for statement of cash flows: A decrease in an asset (receivables, inventory, prepaid expense) account is an addition to net income. You just need to remember one of those and then you can remember that everything else is opposite.

{"post_id":"1hctc6d","subreddit":"wguaccounting","title":"I passed D101! These tips worked for me ","selftext":"I just passed my OA for D101 and I am elated! This was my first attempt. I took the PA twice before taking the OA. I would say the PA lines up very closely with the OA, but the Excel portion is much more in-depth on the OA. For the Excel portion, my advice is to go slow, read every single line, and rely on the questions to tell you where to look (e.g. \"reference the cells in F44-H44 in the MOH Table.\") It won't tell you how to calculate things, but you can use logic to figure it out. It feels like it's missing information, but if you read it carefully, then re-read it, you'll find what you need.\n\nI had trouble memorizing the formulas just in general, so I went through the practice quizzes that used all the various formulas. I would copy a question into ChatGPT and say, \"Give me 10 practice problems like this one.\" That basically gave me the same problems, but with different numbers and slightly different wording. Even though I didn't have the calculations fully memorized in my head, the repetition allowed me to basically just use muscle memory when similar problems appeared on the OA. I wouldn't rely on ChatGPT for in-depth explanations of concepts because it definitely deviates from the material in WGU. But it's great as a machine to whip up practice problems based on a set structure. It would also work to do the PA, then do it again, then do it again.  Memorizing the answers won't help, but doing the calculations over and over and over will help. Just try to get used to actually doing the equations instead of trying to memorize everything and keep it in your head. I still understand the general concepts of the equations, but as a beginning Accounting student, I'm OK with not being able to explain ALL the details of why every single equation is what it is. That will come with more practice whenever I get my first Accounting job.\n\nThe class is overwhelming and I think it could easily be broken into 2 totally separate classes considering the sheer volume of material. It took me 3 weeks to get through the class, and I probably spent about 15 hours per week on it. I had no Accounting background or experience before starting this program.","permalink":"\/r\/wguaccounting\/comments\/1hctc6d\/i_passed_d101_these_tips_worked_for_me\/","created_utc":1734032293,"score":30,"text_length":2226,"vader_compound":0.8688,"course_code":"D101"}

I was pretty nervous heading in. I will say that memorizing is key. I also wouldn't suggest taking your time with this course. The caveat to that statement is if you are studying a module and then going back over all your notes and studying from passed modules, then take your time. My brain doesn't hold onto information very well and remembering formulas from two weeks ago that are similar to what I learned today, is not something I am good at. \n\n  \nThe excel portion of this is course is the Master Budgeting. Study section well and right before you take the test, so it is fresh in your mind for the OA. Don't stress about knowing how many pounds a gallon of milk is. All the information you need is provided. They tell you how many pounds per you unit you need to use. Know how to get to the # of units needed with the information they give you. \n\n  \nI struggled with the Standard Costs and Variances, because I couldn't keep all the formulas straight. If I had been smart I would have reviewed them all again 1-hour before the exam, committed them to short-term memory, and written them down on my whiteboard as soon as I started the exam. \n\nRead the questions slowly and completely. You have 3 hours. I usually take less than 1 hour on an exam, this one too me just under 2 hours. Take your time. Take a break if you need it. I think right around question 40 I started to get fatigued. The master budgeting for me, was the last 8 questions on the exam. \n\n  \nThis class is very formula heavy, but it can be done in as little as two weekends if you can take the time to really focus. \n\nTake notes that mean something to you. \n\nWatch the videos in the text. The red pen will make your eyes bleed, but it really helped me understand the process vs reading the text. \n\nMEMORIZE those formulas. You will never have to remember them again (that is what Google is for) but memorize them. \n\n  \nWith the exception of the Excel portion, the OA is very similar to the PA. Some of the questions are exactly the same, with different values. \n\n  \nGood Luck! You can do this.

{"post_id":"1gkp1kp","subreddit":"wguaccounting","title":"D250 Government & Non-Profit Accounting OA passed- Thoughts and Tips","selftext":"Fair Warning - alignment is only somewhat there between the OA and the Pre-Assessment with this one, and the OA seemed a lot harder (although I also did better than I thought I did after checking my score). In general, the Pre-Assessment is a lot more \"conceptual\" than the OA, which felt more calculation-heavy.\n\n**Tips On The OA:**\n\n* Know how Bond calculations and journal entries work, including what counts as an expenditure related to Bonds and how to record premiums. You will actually need to calculate the amortized premium or discount on a Bond purchase for the first payment, so you can show the proper journal entry.\n* The Non-Profit section was far more difficult than the PA, with questions related to how to record and display stuff like program revenue\/costs versus supporting costs\/revenue, what types of revenue, etc.\n* Make sure you know what types of funds have which financial statements, and how they're shown in the Government-Wide Financial Statements.\n* Fewer questions on this one versus the PA when it came to the ACFR, but you still need to know the structure of it and what goes where generally.\n* You need to have a good understanding of how revenues and expenditures are recorded for governmental funds, including stuff like vacations, sick leave, etc. Hint - for a governmental fund, expenditures on vacation pay are \"pay go\" (IE you only record the amount expended in the period, so if an employee used 10 hours of vacation leave, it would be 10 hours times their hourly pay).\n* Still a fair amount of general conceptual questions, like \"what type of fund uses what basis of accounting\" and so forth.\n* Make sure you know the three methods of determining impairment loss on assets, especially Reservation Cost and Units. This was far tougher than the PA, which basically gives you the answer almost compared to these.\n* **You must ABSOLUTELY be careful to keep an eye out as to whether it's describing a Governmental Fund using Modified Accrual, or one of the other ones using Full Accrual.** \n\nHere are my scores:\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/a4kw1k0t77zd1.png?width=909&format=png&auto=webp&s=51bf84cfa52757ada8228c93eef2ddbd66ed432f\n\nLike I said, I did a lot better on this that I thought I did.\n\n**Thoughts on the Class:**\n\nThis class really doesn't have a lot of material to work with. It's basically just the textbook, the quizzes after each chapter, and the A and B Unit Tests for each Unit. There's no recorded cohorts\\*, and the Powerpoints are from the publisher and kind of useless. Best you can do is thoroughly read the chapters, take the quizzes, take the \"A\" tests, take the PA, then study more and take the \"B\" tests to prepare for the OA.\n\n\\* Although they do occasionally have instructor drop-in sessions in the Learning Lounge, which are cool. Clint Dillard is great as a course instructor if you get him - I've had him for multiple courses in the MACC, and he's helpful and very quick to respond if you ask him a question by email. \n\n**How I Did the Class:**\n\nThis class took 15 days, although I didn't really get any coursework done on Halloween so it was more like 14 days. I studied about 30-40 hours per week, generally aiming to complete a chapter each day and occasionally doing more (some of the later chapters - and units - are shorter than the really long early ones). I took *lots* of Memory Notes that aren't meant to be read later, but which you use to anchor your learning from the reading.  Writing front and back on each page, I used about 4-5 of those 70 page cheap notebooks. \n\n","permalink":"\/r\/wguaccounting\/comments\/1gkp1kp\/d250_government_nonprofit_accounting_oa_passed\/","created_utc":1730863184,"score":11,"text_length":3498,"vader_compound":0.9903,"course_code":"D250"}

If you see something repeated two or three times, especially across different modules and units, take a note of it. This method was best for prioritizing information to study for me than the quizzes and tests themselves.\n\nModule quizzes, and unit tests, and pre-assessmsnt are good ways to cement essential concepts, and fun for personal learning, but don't rely on them for pre-test review. \n\nI found the Quizlets people for this class made to be unreliable or not useful.\n\nThe instructor encourages understanding of how the history\/government works\/intertwines vs rote memorization, and it's true. I enjoyed using concept maps\/visual guides more than focusing on definitions to know how things connected to eachother.\n\nDo:\n--Units 2, 3, 4, 5 have the most foundational and essential information. I would personally skim the other units and concentrate on the ones specified above.\n--Have a solid understanding of the branches of government and how they work. If you can explain the checks and balances and constituional powers you're good.\n--Legislative branch was the most complicated, understand House Of Represantives, Senate, and checks and balances of it.\n--Memorize all Amendments, understand Bill of Rights.\n--Review all court cases, but pay special attention to court cases that relate to amendments and the ones reviewed in the appendix.\n--Have a solid understanding the the critiques of the election process, PACS, and court cases related.\n\nDon't:\n-Focus heavily on dates.\n-Focus on names\/cases\/definitions brought up less than two or three times.\n\nOnce I understood that I couldn't skim for vocabulary\/definitions this class for easier for me.

{"post_id":"1k7chfy","subreddit":"WGU","title":"I can't even believe I passed D522 (Python for IT Automation)","selftext":"This was a tough one. I tracked 59 hours of pretty darn focused study time starting from zero python experience. And know there were some more hours I studied without tracking it. On top of that I've written over 100 scripts drilling ChatGPT-generated practice drills that are similarly structured to the Practice Questions in Chapter 16\/the PA. There's no getting around it - to pass this class you need to learn to code. Memorizing answers to the PA questions will not get you to the other side of the mountain. You need to be able to read a question and answer it using practical coding knowledge.\n\nWhat I did:\n\n1 - Went through Zybooks chapters 1-9, and 16\n\n2 - Go through one of the many quizlets on syntax and just get it figured out. Don't have to be perfect, but you need to know the basics of what a dictionary, tuple, list, set looks like and what operators to use for certain things. Don't go too crazy with this because most of it will come as you practice coding\n\n3 - Took the PA 3 different times on different occasions for different reasons\n\n4 - Watched the freecodecamp 4 hour Python tutorial and followed along somewhat\n\n5 - Went through all the drills on w3schools. These were helpful because they weren't super complex but they helped me figure out how to work with smaller portions of medium sized code blocks.\n\n6 - Trained ChatGPT to be a python tutor for beginners. You really need to specify for beginners otherwise it will teach you at an intermediate\/advanced level which I guarantee if you don't have coding experience, you are not ready for.\n\nAt this point I basically just spent countless hours giving my best shot at different practice problems and saving scripts I wrote in their own folders on my computer. So for each study session I would have a \"Session 1\" or \"Session 2\" folder, etc. and save all my completed scripts to that folder for future reference.\n\nOnce I had a dozen or so of these, if I got stuck on a problem, I would reference those before asking ChatGPT to help me. Eventually I started getting the hang of different concepts. But this part alone is probably where I spent the majority of my time.\n\nDo this for about 40-50 hours and eventually you'll have some confidence built up and be able to win.\n\nAs far as the exam goes, I know for a FACT that I only got 5\/10 of the coding questions right. The other 5 threw curveballs at me in ways I hadn't anticipated. Seeing as there are 30 questions, and 24\/30 would be 80%, and my green bar is slightly over the minimum, I most likely got 25\/30 correct meaning I didn't miss any of the multiple choice questions. I used up all 3 hours of the exam time and was 100% sure by the end of it that I had failed again. But what do you know, I actually passed. This was my 2nd attempt, by the way, for whatever that's worth. Long story short, this one put me through the ringer, but I'm gonna repeat what has been said in the echo chamber of those who have actually passed this class and say if I can do it, so can you.

{"post_id":"1k718gx","subreddit":"WGU","title":"I passed D278 - Scripting and Programming Foundations in 17 days. Here's how I did it.","selftext":"Greetings, Night Owls. This is a guide where I explain the strategies and resources I used to pass the OA for D278. \n\nThe first thing you have to do in order to succeed is to complete ALL of the Participation Activities and Challenge Activities in Modules 2-6, Module 7.1 and 7.2, and Modules 8-9. You can skip Module 1, the rest of Module 7 after you complete 7.1 and 7.2, and Module 10 since it doesn't teach anything relevant for the OA. If you have a hard time understanding or completing any of the Participation Activities or Challenge Activities, you can watch these webinars that go over all of the relevant modules: [https:\/\/youtube.com\/playlist?list=PLRf5DMgXLHAPm3KHH3AQZWoYzdk-FkFn7&si=1UbVX-ewJ3Ap2ObU](https:\/\/youtube.com\/playlist?list=PLRf5DMgXLHAPm3KHH3AQZWoYzdk-FkFn7&si=1UbVX-ewJ3Ap2ObU)\n\nNote that the Lab Activities are OPTIONAL, but they may help you understand the content material if you're stuck. \n\nOnce you've completed all of the required Participation Activities and Challenge Activities, you'll now begin reviewing for the OA. I reviewed by **reading** through the relevant material and exercises. You don't have to **redo** the exercises, but you may do so to further enhance your understanding of the course content. Personally, all I did to review was read through the relevant material and exercises three times over before taking the OA. \n\n  \nAs for the Pre-Assessment, take it after you review the relevant content once over. From my experience, the Pre-A was similar to the OA but that may not be the case for you. In my opinion, if you can pass the Pre-A you should be ready for the OA. If you don't feel ready just yet, then continue reading through the relevant content multiple times over to increase your confidence. \n\nThat's all she wrote. By using the above strategies and resources, I was able to complete this class in 17 days even though the only programming experience I have is writing little scripts in Python as a hobby. Just work hard, study the relevant material, use additional material such as the linked webinars and the Lab Activities if you need it, and you'll pass the OA. I believe in you, Night Owl!","permalink":"\/r\/WGU\/comments\/1k718gx\/i_passed_d278_scripting_and_programming\/","created_utc":1745523343,"score":1,"text_length":2069,"vader_compound":0.9279,"course_code":"D278"}

Super boring class focusing on business jargon, but 100% doable to finish relatively quickly. Sharing my experience and some tips in case it helps anyone else :)\n\nPrefacing that I already work in IT and in an environment where I\u2019m exposed to these concepts regularly, so I was able to apply my knowledge and finish this class in under a week with 2-3 hrs of daily studying. If I had no prior experience though, I\u2019d say the class could take 2 weeks or so.\n\nMy main 3 courses of study were:\n- Value Insights YouTube vids (good intro to course material and straight to the point, whole playlist took about 1.5ish hours)\n- Jason Dion\u2019s 6 practice exams (questions are structured similar to real exam)\n- [this Quizlet](https:\/\/quizlet.com\/771266163\/itil-4-foundations-flash-cards\/?i=etra3&x=1jqY)\n\nExam questions were pretty straightforward, but I had a couple questions about the continual improvement register(?), and I guessed on all of them since I don\u2019t remember ever seeing that in any of the material I studied lol. The Cohort videos and\/or Sample Papers from ITIL\u2019s official learning resources that come with the exam voucher probably cover that small topic, so I would recommend looking into those for 100% comprehension.\n\nExam itself through PeopleCert and their proctoring was a bit of a pain since their room requirements were stricter (no windows and only 1 door allowed wtf), but I felt the check-in process went a lot smoother than WGU\u2019s process.

I dont think I scored higher then an 80 on the 3 I took.\n* Did 4 of the 6 Jason Dion exams - never scored higher then an 80 on them. I did not actually go through his course.\n* Skimmed through the CertMaster because WGU requires it for the voucher, never looked at it again once I got the 90 on the practice assessment.\n* I think I worried a little too much about scripting languages, the Sybex focuses on them but at least for the version I took I would only really be concerned with python, bash, and powershell. I dont recall any questions on perl or Ruby.\n* I would also say make sure you know ROE, SOW, MSA, etc. and the steps of the cyber kill chain as well.\n\nIn all, I thought this exam was easier then CySA+.

I got booted from the exam three times. I would be on question 30-50, and when I came back to the exam, it put me back at 13 and gave me a whole set of new questions. I probably answered more questions from this exam set than anyone. Got to the end, and it said I was disconnected from my proctor.

Hopefully, the exam people will accept it fully. \n\nAnyways, this is a long-winded way to tell you....I don't know what to tell you.

We can say it's my fault for getting two assignments submitted with 8 days left to go in the term. Sure. I'll own that.\n\nBut I'm also a staff member at Florida State, which just had a deadly shooting a week ago Thursday. I've been working a marathon to install, activate, and configure every individual help request from every instructor necessary across a campus of 40 or 50,000 students get their final exams switched over to our third-party proctoring system so students can take their exams off campus because many of them don't feel safe returning.

First, I watched parts of the [LinkedIn Learning course](https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/learning\/oracle-database-12c-administration\/welcome?u=2045532) \u2014 mainly the first few sections \u2014 but honestly, I got bored and couldn't stay focused. I checked Reddit for advice, but it made me even more anxious because a lot of people were saying it\u2019s a tough class and that you have to read the entire book, which I'm not great at.\n\nA lot of Reddit posts also recommended using Quizlet flashcards, but personally, I do not recommend them. Most of the flashcards just have the PA questions and answers without explaining why the answers are right or wrong. Plus, there are like 500+ flashcards \u2014 it\u2019s overwhelming, and if you memorize them before taking the PA, it might give you a false sense of understanding. You might think you\u2019re ready, but when you take the OA, you could end up failing.\n\nInstead, I found the [WGU webinar](https:\/\/wgu.hosted.panopto.com\/Panopto\/Pages\/Viewer.aspx?id=667f1502-63b8-4662-a097-b044000cbef6) through a Reddit post and watched the whole thing 2 times \u2014 I 100% recommend it because it helped me understand about 70% of the material. After that, I used this [GitHub page](https:\/\/github.com\/webmastersmith\/WGU_Cloud_Computing\/blob\/main\/D330_Data_Systems_Administration\/Data_Systems_Administration.md) to study specific topics like Oracle background processes, backup strategies, and file locations.\n\nI didn\u2019t even attempt the PA at first \u2014 when I did, I used ChatGPT while taking it to understand why answers were right or wrong. Once I passed the PA, I scheduled my OA right away, quickly reviewed key concepts again with ChatGPT, and then passed the OA in 35 minutes.\n\nIf you focus on the webinar, the GitHub notes, and understanding Oracle basics, you\u2019ll be fine without needing to read the book or memorize hundreds of flashcards. Good luck!\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/omi2nen6g7xe1.png?width=1710&format=png&auto=webp&s=5a5291cfa989d9a51f0f5876a7461eb9e16282dc\n\n  \n","permalink":"\/r\/WGU\/comments\/1k8grnl\/passed_d330_sharing_what_actually_worked\/","created_utc":1745684486,"score":2,"text_length":1629,"vader_compound":0.4409,"course_code":"D330"}

I received exemplary in Financial Environment and approaching competence in everything else.\n\nSecond practice assessment (Pass): April 24, 2025 - Pass, but not comfortable with my margins here so I didn't take the OA right away.\n\nOA (Pictured): April 28, 2025. I only studied from the 20th-24th and had to work the days between then and the OA. \n\nNightmare class. Extremely information dense and particular for only three CUs. I would not take the results above as representative of my understanding because I am certain I got lucky guessing on ratio questions. I also struggled because of strong religious objections to the use of interest bringing me into this course with less than zero enthusiasm, but I don't expect this will be a barrier for most of you.\n\nTwo notable struggle points:\n\n1. Variable and overly-specialized jargon. There are several different vocabulary terms they use to mean \"interest\" that are only differentiated by which financial instrument it is utilized in. I got two questions hinging on this point, which probably didn't amount to much but I was annoyed by it anyway.\n\n2. Information density. There is a lot here you need to know for the OA. Ratios alone are a large part of the test, and there are a dozen of those. You need to understand how they are used and what variables can be changed to get specific results with each ratio. I got lucky here with guessing. This was worse than Managing Operations and Project Management for me. I am usually pretty good about self-evaluating my competence prior to taking any test, but there was no point during this course that I felt comfortable with myself just because of the amount of information I felt like I had to have control over.\n\nIt sounds ridiculous to say this given that I passed as well as I did after only studying for four days, but compared to other classes I've done, the amount of material and the degree to which you need to understand it all feel very disproportionate to the amount of competency units awarded.\n\nExcel was nothing. I saw a lot of people complaining about it but if you just understand the acronyms and what the questions are asking for, just find the formula in the formulas tab in Excel and input the data.\n\nMy study practice is to watch recorded cohorts first at 2x speed. If that isn't enough (some classes it is), I go into textbooks and skip to unit\/module tests to see if I need to spend my time reading, which I'll do or listen to narrations at 2x speed.

{"post_id":"1kb3247","subreddit":"WGU","title":"D196 RANT","selftext":"I literally studied this one class for 6mo. I didn't pay any of my other classes any mind :( Honestly? It is ridiculous to expect students to consume SO MUCH accounting information (over 30 chapters across 8-10 modules) to only be tested with 62 questions.\n\nDon't get me wrong. I'm not asking for more questions. What I am saying is that if you are going to give us THAT much information overload (videos, cohorts, reading, formula sheets) test us accordingly and for the love of Gee Oh Dee--let us use a formula sheet. In the real-world, employees of all kinds, including those specializing in accounting, will reference the internet or a book should they find themselves stuck on an accounting problem.\n\nIf you have the memory of an elephant, you can literally just learn from the videos. If you are a person who struggles with memorizing sht ..take your time but master a few chapters so that you don't get so caught up on formulas.\n\nThe OA asks about contribution margin and target margin. Did it ask about contribution ratio? NOOO. It asks about \"articulation\". I completely forgot what that means. Took an educated guess. It asks about the effects on the accounting equation when a transaction is made (Example: Company borrowed 50,000...how does it affect the accounts...assets increase\/decrease...owners equity increases\/decreases, etc). Know what EDGAR is used for. Know the differences between Cost Systems (Process, JOB, ABC) because there are multiple questions about this.\n\nLearn and perfect the chart creation process. They give you this long-drawn-out explanation in the book. All you gotta do? Highlight the months its asking you to include in the chart (OCT, NOV, DEC)...while those are highlighted, click and hold CTRL on your keyboard then highlight the amounts that correspond to those months (say cash disbursements)...THEN click on \"Create Chart>2D Chart\". Guess what? It will auto-create the chart for you. But the material wants to give you long drawn out bull. If you are comparing two figures for each mo (say cash disbursements vs net income) all you gotta do is add those secondary amounts while holding down ctrl and they will be auto-populated.\n\nMy advice? Look at 6-week study guide under the Course Tips >D196 Resources link and focus on those topics with large percents (Costing Methodologies are 20%) for example. Those that are 10%...become an expert on those topics, specifically if you struggle with remember the formulas.\n\nI swear my report shows I have a high-level competence on the subject but guess what? I forgot most of the ish I studied already.\n\nPS Just took and passed the OA on my first try today, 2nd to last day of my term (gave myself that extra day in the event I didn't make it).

Hold on though, because you\u2019ll wanna hear what I have to say next if you\u2019re yet to take it. \n\nTo give a small bit of background, I took more time studying for this than I wanted to or ever even should have. I found success with CertMaster for A+ but the CertMaster guide that WGU links you to for Network+ was nowhere near as good. No practice PBQ\u2019s, flashcards or any of the resources I found useful. It also was the most anti beginner friendly content I\u2019ve digested thus far. It\u2019s actually the reason I wasted so much time. I ended up just utilizing Jason Dion videos & practice tests to fill in the gaps until I could score an 85% on the final CertMaster test.\n\nSo to give a few details about my exam: It was 79 questions with 7 PBQ\u2019s (absolute sadists). I always take these exams by actually spending enough time on the PBQ\u2019s first so I don\u2019t have to review them. 1-2 were easy, while the others were all very challenging. A lot of CLI, so make sure you have the gist of the Cisco global configuration commands down. I spent almost 35 minutes in the PBQ\u2019s\u2026 so as you can imagine, having 55 minutes left, with 72 questions left to answer, definitely made me nervous. I got to about question 25 when I quietly said to myself\u2026 I\u2019m going to fail this exam. I am getting absolutely cooked. At that point, I just made sure I got through all 79 questions, and spent the remaining 3-4 minutes I had left, reviewing my flagged questions and just saying fuck it for the ones I couldn\u2019t. \nI didn\u2019t even entertain that 15 question survey at the end. I just put \u201cno answer\u201d for all of them because I wanted to get my failing score, and get on with the rest of my day. I submitted the last question of the survey and my score was presented on screen. To my complete astonishment, I scored an 817\/900. I\u2019m honestly still sitting here in total disbelief, thinking it\u2019s some sort of long-winded dream I\u2019m having or something; But nope, I passed, and not only did I pass, I crushed it. For context, I was displeased with my A+ 1 & 2 scores, 738 & 758 respectively. This was a MUCH tougher exam and I performed much better. I doubted myself so much that it began to affect my personal life to be honest.\n\nThe reason I\u2019m saying any of this, outside of building a bunch of tension for theatrical purposes, is to get a few points across:\n\u2022 Believe in yourself.\n\u2022 Failing several practice exams is an amazing thing, but only if you take inventory of what you missed and why you missed it, and then do some supplementary studying to fill in the gaps. Go fail those practice exams proudly so you don\u2019t have to fail a high stakes exam.\n\u2022 Stressing accomplishes nothing. Easier said than done, but I feel like I ended up performing better by just saying fuck it and just getting the exam over with.\n\u2022 Do NOT use the CertMaster course that is linked with the course material.

No Stress Acquired.","selftext":"I was initially intimidated by this class because of its reputation, but it turned out to be one of the most enjoyable and approachable courses I\u2019ve taken. I have a feeling the real challenge\u2014and the reason for that reputation\u2014might be waiting for me in Discrete Math 2. Nonetheless, here is what I did:\n\nMy goal was to complete two modules a day, though on lazier days, I sometimes settled for just one.\n\nAround two hours daily allowed me to finish the course in around 2\u20133 weeks. I would recommend doing the ZyBooks and only watching Kimberly Brehm videos when you do not understand.\n\nFor Units 4, 6, and 7, I highly recommend watching the Kimberly Brehm\u2019s videos before going to the zybooks. Not because of difficulty, but because of ease. You'll be able to breeze through chapters and perhaps also the entirety of Unit 4.\n\nOverall, the Zybooks content covered about 80% of what I needed, but at times, it leaned heavily into math jargon that made things impossible to follow.\n\nInterestingly, the pre-assessment felt much tougher than the actual Objective Assessment. Half of the real exam could be handled with basic algebra and some logical reasoning. Honestly, I think they may have significantly toned down the difficulty. Based off the PA, I was halfway convinced I was going to fail, but it turned out to be much more manageable.\n\nI passed with an 80%. I'd rate this class a 3\/10 in difficulty. I can easily see how someone can get overwhelmed if they do not get a good grasp of the foundational knowledge. This class would probably be an 8\/10 if I couldn't do 2 hours everyday.\n\nTIPS-\n\nQuite honestly, all the units practiced the same logic but repackaged with new terms\/scopes. Getting a good base understanding when they introduce new concepts will help you immensely.\n\nWhen the math jargon was too much, it was often easier to just watch the demonstration and reverse engineer the concept. It could be best to watch the demonstration first, then go back to the paragraphs.\n\nMake sure to do all the Unit Worksheets. You don't have to get them correct, but make you sure understand why you are wrong. I skipped all the Zybook exercises though.\n\nCertain niche math concepts were too complicated for me to understand so I simply skipped them. I would only do this if it didn't show up in the worksheets.\n\nTI-84 probably solved me around 8 questions for free.\n\nONLY do Zybooks and supplement with Kimberly Brehm.\n\nI found this time table to be accurate and very helpful.\u00a0[https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/WGU\\_CompSci\/comments\/1f4x1fy\/c959\\_discrete\\_math\\_1\\_done\/](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/WGU_CompSci\/comments\/1f4x1fy\/c959_discrete_math_1_done\/)","permalink":"\/r\/WGU_CompSci\/comments\/1kax6hg\/c959_discrete_math_1_finished_in_20_days_no\/","created_utc":1745956310,"score":29,"text_length":2545,"vader_compound":0.9951,"course_code":"C959"}

Maybe spend more time on the quizlet. \n\nIt is absolutely important you understand every concept that I list above outside of the Summary Notes.

{"post_id":"1kcg9lh","subreddit":"WGU","title":"Mini Rant","selftext":"I'm usually very supportive of WGU, the classes, etc., but I have my first complaint as I'm getting close to the end of my BS here. I had a great mentor, and then WGU started return to work policies, and she left. It looks like there are many unhappy employees at WGU, and reading in another group, people are leaving there in large numbers. I'm not sure if it's true, but I've seen many more complaints lately about mentors, class instructors, support, and enrollment being slower than usual or not answering. So, back to my issue, my new mentor is one of those I've heard about, generic canned emails that really don't mean anything to me, no answers to my questions for days, and even when I get a reply, it doesn't answer my question. If this is because they are overworked, then I completely understand, but she sent me a high-priority email covering the 14-day policy about no activity. I'm in D076 and have been doing the quizzes, tests, etc., on a daily basis. I have emailed her at least weekly with updates, and I've already passed 2 classes in my new semester. I replied and asked her if this was meant for me, because if so, it was a mistake, and we needed to find out why. My response 4 days later was \"Thanks for letting me know and good luck on your course.\" In the month they have been my mentor, I've had three canned emails with pictures in them, two congrats for passing my course, 3-4 days after I passed, and that's really it. I don't require handholding or motivation, but this just seems lame lol. My old mentor would check on me via email 2 times a week at least, and we'd chat. She never required phone calls and always helped me move forward very quickly, replying the same day at a minimum.

The class only has a PA and the PA has two tasks. This post covers Task 2 for the PA; and overall the class.\n\nTask 2 involves 2 main parts:\n\n1. Creating functions in Python using Python libraries for implementing the data structures for the related operations\u00a0for a Warehouse logistics company to create inventory and order management software\n2. Writing a paper + README file\n\n**Estimated Time**\n\n* Task 1: 1 day to complete PA\n* Task 2: 1 day to complete PA\n\nThis class is possible to be passed in 1 week if you skip the course material, pass the PA task submissions on 1st attempt, and submit the tasks back-to-back.\n\n*Note: Idk if we can submit Task 1 and Task 2 at the same time, or if Task 2 will have to wait until Task 1 is graded and passes*\n\nThe reason it took me 1 month was because I spent a few days going through the course material, didn't do any school work for 2 weeks, and only worked on the PA tasks over the weekend + Monday.\n\n**Task 2 Requirements**\n\n1. **Section A:** Setup your GitLab repository for the project, and frequently commit when completing each requirement\n2. **Section B:** Re-describe the business requirements (you can copy it from Task 1), determine the required operations to meet each business requirement, and implement the operations as separate Python functions implementing each operation (and use at least 2 different data structures)\n3. **Section C:** Test the functions created in Section B for different inputs & use-cases, provide screenshots of the results from testing the functions, and create a README file\n   1. Testing Tip: You can create unit tests to test your functions, which you can test each unit test individually (adding a print statement for the results) and screenshot the results for the pictures\n      1. *Note: Google\/ChatGPT to find out a Python unit testing library to use*\n      2. Also, I used the `pydantic` library for type annotations and data validation\n   2. README  - Code Examples Tip: One of the requirements is to add code examples for running the functions, you can copy\/paste your unit test code (removing the asserts) for the examples to run the function, and add it as a code block\n   3. README - Documentation Tip: You can add code documentation comments for each of your Python functions, then copy\/paste it to the README for the requirement of the function descriptions\n\n**Side Note - Space Optimization Suggestion Requirement**\n\nFor the business requirement related to space optimization suggestions for the warehouse, I went with a simple approach of:\n\n1. Each warehouse has a variable that holds its max capacity\n2. Stored the inventory level for each product\n3. Subtracted the warehouse max capacity from the total inventory, and returned a string if the warehouse could accept more inventory or it reached capacity\n\nThis requirement was the main one where I was confused at the start as to how to implement. Originally, I was thinking of a more complicated implementation by calculating the size of the warehouse capacity (floor space) vs the dimensions of different product sizes...\n\n*Note: You can look through the Course Material because there's a page on how to do this but for storing different sized shapes in a bag*\n\n**Feedback for Class**\n\n1. Automated Grading for Coding Assignments - GaTech Online Master of Science in Computer Science (OMSCS) has automated grading using a website called \"GradeScope\" for some classes that have coding projects. You can get feedback in real-time if you passed x test cases or not\n2.

{"post_id":"1kdhnm6","subreddit":"wgu_devs","title":"Passed D427 - Data Management Applications - My First Attempt! Please Read To Save Yourself!","selftext":"Guys, I did the OA for the new version of D427. I can tell you that OA accurately resembled the PA (Seriously). I thought I was doing the PA. Before I go into what I was asked and what you should study. Let me start off by telling you that was the most stupid exam I ever did in my life and WGU is my 3rd school so I\u2019ve done a lot of exams. \n\nFirstly, one question asked me to create a view called MyMovie. I created the view, correct syntax, but when I ran it, there was a Zybooks error that said MyMovie didn\u2019t exist even though the question explicitly asked me to create the view and call it \u201cMyMovie\u201d\u2026 I was confused and irritated. Didn\u2019t know what to do but the previous question asked me to alter a view called \u201cMyMovies\u201d. Therefore, my mind randomly said why don\u2019t you just add an s to MyMovie even though they didn\u2019t ask for \u201cMyMovies\u201d, they explicitly asked you for \u201cMyMovie\u201d. I added an s and the error went away. That made no sense at all! The question asked me to create a view called \u201cMyMovie\u201d NOT \u201cMyMovies\u201d. \n\nSecondly, a question asked me to delete all movies released before the year 2000. I wrote code, it ran without errors but Zybooks has this button where you can run the code against test cases and it provides feedback.. the feedback said \u201cFAIL: 5 movies still exist that were released before 2020\u201d. When I say that I was so dumbfounded, the question asked me to delete movies released before 2000, not 2020.. so the question asked for 2000 but the test case tested the code against 2020 instead. LOL. Since I realized this, I changed 2000(even though that\u2019s what the question asked) to 2020 and it finally worked and passed the test case. That was confusing. \n\nThere were some other errors on the exam. 3-4 questions in total that I can\u2019t remember. I wrote them down for the instructor but the proctor made me clear my whiteboard and I told her there was errors on the exam. I am so ready to report this shit so they can get it fixed because I almost failed and it wasn\u2019t my fault. It seems the new version of the course is filled with errors!!! \n\nAnyway, WHAT YOU SHOULD KNOW TO PASS: \n\nFor writing SQL code:\n\n1. How to create a table(know datatypes), how to insert into a table, how to delete a row from a table. \n2. How to alter a table, column. \n3. How to drop a view, how create a view, how to alter an already existing view. \n4. How to do JOINS. My question asked me to create a RIGHT JOIN. Doesn\u2019t seem I got it correct because Zybooks said my syntax was wrong. (It was not, there\u2019s literally a reference sheet in the exam that shows you how to write the syntax). \n5. How to use MAX(), SUM(). \n6. How to use order by, group by. \n\nFor multiple choice: \n1. Know how to identify attributes, know cardinality, know how joins work. \n\nTo conclude, I\u2019ve read all the horrors about this course on here. Therefore, I was scared to take the OA. Very scared. Finally gave it a shot and passed. If you can pass the PA, do Practice Test 1,2,3 on your own. Then you will pass. Don\u2019t overthink it, but Zybooks may set you up to fail.

{"post_id":"1kdb9rh","subreddit":"wgu_devs","title":"Git requirements rant","selftext":"Okay, admittedly, this is maybe an issue of me reading directions thoroughly and\/or seeking clarification, but I'm still annoyed.\n\nDoing the D280 (JavaScript\/Angular) World Map project. As seems standard, the project says \"Commit with a message and push to the Working branch when you complete\u00a0*each*\u00a0requirement listed in parts C, D, E, and F.\"\n\nI'm the kind of person who looks at the end goal and likes to figure out my own way to get there. So when starting this project, it made sense to me to build the map interface first, so I did that: built the map that would highlight countries as you hovered over them and read the data for the country ID code into a variable. The interactive element is technically Step F.\n\nStep C, the first step that requires a documented commit, says \"\u00a0Using the \"World Bank API\" web link, identify\u00a0*each*\u00a0of the following\u00a0**six**\u00a0properties for\u00a0*each*\u00a0country: ...\" Which I don't even know what that \\*means\\* in a vacuum. Identify in what way? Should I have built a text interface that takes a country code and returns the six properties? It just made the most sense to me, since the SVG files included country codes anyway, to read them from there. And to further the confusion, Part G is technically the step where you're supposed to build the full API service. So truly, what was I supposed to commit in Part C if not an API service of some kind?\n\nSo my first commit was like 90% of the app, really: an interactive map with API connection. Step D is routing and E is the HTML layout, so those were done quickly. I realized my mistake when I committed E so I wrote in that commit note (paraphrased): \"Here's E, oh and also I actually completed F in my initial commit.\" I also noted this to the evaluator.\n\nIt got returned unevaluated because of the commits, but I'm not actually even sure how to resolve the issue. I noticed that also I didn't technically specify that I completed \"Part C\" in my commit - I just wrote \"completed map interface with API query.\"\n\nLike would it have passed if I had said \"Completed part C and F\" in my first commit? Or if I had had committed F and C as two seperate commits with mostly the same code?

It feels weird leaving the proctor site to open Excel and even weirder at the end--I had to ask my proctor twice if I was done and it was fully submitted. Also, I don't like how it doesn't show you the normal competency screen--on the PA, the MyEducator thing did show me what I lost points on, but that doesn't actually tell me a percent. And then when I click coaching report, it is just grayed out and only shows pass here. Annoying, but over! \n\nMy only advice would be to go through the PA file until you are comfortable doing each task without looking anything up! I use Excel regularly, so this wasn't new to me, but the only way to learn Excel is through repetition! \n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/wuuyoywtxvye1.png?width=1312&format=png&auto=webp&s=258fa3e2d114dae0e6eaee3c7e9c8e7f7dc3d3e4\n\n","permalink":"\/r\/WGU\/comments\/1kf2gox\/class_3_down_the_hatch_d388\/","created_utc":1746417032,"score":2,"text_length":761,"vader_compound":0.8582,"course_code":"D388"}

I had previously read that some people noticed some pretty bad errors such as the screen freezing and you're unable to put anymore inputs in.\n\nWell I had the same experience. I got to question 21 of 25 using the WGU browser ( I can't say it by name) and I could not submit any queries or go back to the previous question or go to the next question. I alerted the proctor and told him to look at what's going on. He took control of my mouse and noticed the same errors. He then opened Chrome (I didn't ask him to) and re-opened the test using Chrome. I was able to get through the test up to question 24 before the test froze again. Again, I alerted the instructor. He took control and noted the same thing, again. Instead of attempting to resolve the issue or reach out to someone, he asked me to wait patiently. 10 minutes go by, I ask for an update. He, again, tells me to wait, Another 20 minutes go by, I demand an update because we're pushing hour 2 of my allotted exam time. He ask me to wait. I start clicking a bunch of buttons in the settings portion of the zybooks test, causing him to ask me if the test works again. I replied with no. He attempts to open up a different webpage on chrome and have me input all the answers a third time, to which I stop him and demand that the issue be resolved or that I needed to speak to a supervisor. His only reply was take it up with WGU.\n\nI go back and forth a few more times with him because I'm hot. Eventually he just tells me to close the browser and figure it out. Miraculously, I was able to reschedule the test but i'll probably end up rescheduling it again. I'm still in the midst of drafting up a scathing email to my instructor and mentor.\n\n**With that being said, I highly encourage anyone that is taking this class to wait a little bit for them to fix all of the bugs inside of it. They already had a ton of complaints by the second day the course was live because people kept encountering errors when they were attempting to schedule the test.**","permalink":"\/r\/WGUIT\/comments\/1ke2mfm\/just_had_the_worst_testing_experience_d427_oa\/","created_utc":1746304835,"score":7,"text_length":2151,"vader_compound":-0.6609,"course_code":"D427"}

{"post_id":"1ke7olx","subreddit":"WGU_CompSci","title":"Passed Intro to Computer Science D684 - Review","selftext":"**Initial Thoughts + Timeline:** I passed the OA on my first attempt. Overall, this course isn't too terribly difficult. I would say, all in all, it took about 2 weeks to complete, and that was not spent studying every single day. Life happens, and I was not able to study every day. Realistically, even if you have 0 experience or knowledge in this class, if you spent a good amount of time really locking in and studying, you could knock it out in 1 week. \n\n  \n**My Experience:** I was part of the old BSCS program and transferred over to the new one in April. This is the first class that is on the new one and was not part of the old program. I had taken *Computer Architecture D952* previously, and I would say this is a great prerequisite to that class. It helps you get familiar with concepts without going too far into the weeds of things. \n\n**OA:** The OA is relatively similar to the PA, but there are some slight differences. Here are some things that you will really want to focus on. \n\n* Programming Basics (You HAVE to know these)\n   * Field\n   * Inhertance\n   * Instantances\n   * Methods\n   * Objects\n   * Record\n   * Argument\n   * Parameters \n      * Parameter List\n      * Parameter Value\n      * Parameter Reference\n*  Disc Scheduling\n   * First Come First Served (FSFS)\n   * SCAN\n   * C-SCAN\n   * LOOK\n* Paradigms (Know similarities and differences as they relate to one another)\n   * Declarative Paradigms\n   * Procedural Programming\n   * Object Oriented Programming\n   * Logic Programming\n   * Functional Programming\n   * Even-Driven Programming\n* Partitioning (Know which is for the best and worst use cases)\n   * Single Partition\n   * Fixed Partition\n   * Dynamic Partition\n   * Multiple Partition\n* Virtual Machine Basics\n   * Page Table\n   * Page Register\n   * Base Register\n   * Limit Register\n   * Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB)\n   * Address Binding\n* Process Life Cycle (Know the purpose)\n   * New \n   * Ready\n   * Running\n   * Waiting\n   * Terminated\n* Loops\n   * For Loop\n   * Count Controlled Loop\n   * While Loop\n   * Do-While Loop\n   * If-Else (I know this isn't technically a loop)\n   * Select Statements \/ Case (I know this isn't technically a loop)\n* Sorting Algorithms + Search Algorithms (MUST KNOW IN DEPTH)\n   * Bubble Sort\n   * Selection Sort\n   * Insertion Sort\n   * Merge Sort\n   * Quick Sort\n   * Radix Sort\n   * Binary Search\n   * Linear Search\n* Ethics and Principles (MUST KNOW IN DEPTH)\n   * Association of Computing Machinery (ACM)\n   * Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)\n* Computing Development Methodologies\n   * Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)\n   * Computer Problem-Solving Process\n* Pseudocode and Flow Charts\n   * Know what each symbol means for Flow Charts\n   * For Pseudocode, knowing how to read and write your own makes it a lot easier\n* File System\n   * Absolute vs Relative Path\n   * How Filing\/Directories Works\n* IT Basics\n   * LAN, WAN, MAN\n   * Networks \/ Topology\n      * Star\n      * Bus \n      * Mesh\n      * Ring\n      * Tree (Didn't see anything on this in the materials, but it helps to know it)\n* Others\n   * CPU Scheduling\n   * Turn Around Time\n   * Process Management\n   * Context Switching\n   * Multiprogramming\n   * Single Contiguous Memory Management\n   * Batch Processing\n   * Integer Division\n   * Round Robin\n   * Preemptive Scheduling & Non-Preemptive Scheduling \n   * IoT\n\nI know this seems like a lot of things to know, but if you really sit down and study these things and you know them by heart, then you are going to be more than okay and will easily pass the OA. If you make a Word DOCX as a study guide, then break it down into these sections, it makes it a lot easier to go back and reference the topics. \n\n  \nI did **not** open the textbooks for anything other than the SDLC, ACM, and IEEE, as I wanted to make sure that I was getting the information as the book teaches it. Everything else was done by using [Quizzets](https:\/\/myquizzets.com\/login.php) or by using the Supplemental Resources Quizzes found in the Course Search. \n\n  \nThese really do help a lot, as they can show you your knowledge in these topics and will really help you visualize what you need to focus on. I did use Chat + Gemini to help explain concepts better, such as Disc Scheduling and the difference in Paradigms. Also, this is a very helpful YT [Playlist](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/playlist?list=PLmtoWHHrNlG-S5ce4osAXZMKpERv5VG3r) that can also help explain the concepts, a user posted it somewhere in this Sub, but I cannot find it to give credit where it is due. I know in another post on this Sub, a user made a Google Docs that links to this YT [Crash Course](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/playlist?list=PL8dPuuaLjXtNlUrzyH5r6jN9ulIgZBpdo) playlist, but this was not helpful to me. I'm still posting it as it may be helpful to you.\n\nHopefully, those of you who are taking this class will be able to profit from this breakdown of the class. I wish you all the best of luck with your studies!!! :) ","permalink":"\/r\/WGU_CompSci\/comments\/1ke7olx\/passed_intro_to_computer_science_d684_review\/","created_utc":1746319739,"score":11,"text_length":4558,"vader_compound":0.9984,"course_code":"D684"}

{"post_id":"1kgid8g","subreddit":"WGU","title":"D333 PA - Submitted Both Tasks in 1 day","selftext":"Update: I passed both tasks on the first try! These tasks are not hard if you stick to the rubric. Don\u2019t overthink it. The rubric tells you exactly what you need to get \u201ccompetent\u201d and the instructions\/questions are straight forward. On a side note, this is the fastest I\u2019ve ever received a task evaluation back (less than 24 hours)\n\n\nThe PA for D333 went live today, 5\/6\/25. I requested my mentor switch me over yesterday, and when I checked today at around noon Central time, it had switched. It took me about 3.5 hours (with breaks) to write Task 1 and another 2 hours (no breaks) for Task 2 (2 pages each task, give or take). The tasks themselves aren\u2019t difficult, but like any other PA task, you do need to follow the rubric closely to be marked competent.\n\nI requested the switch to the PA based on how memorization-heavy the content seemed, Reddit reviews, and reviews in the student  Discord\u2014and so far, I don\u2019t regret it. I'll take an essay or two over a 60-question, timed, proctored exam any day. If you\u2019re comfortable writing detailed essays, the PA route is definitely manageable.\n\nOne thing to note: be sure your sources are correctly formatted and cited both in-text and in your references section. Pay attention to the small stuff, like APA punctuation and including all cited materials in the final source list. This is always what trips me up on most PAs, so I made sure to pay close attention this time around.\n\nOverall, I\u2019d say this is one of the more straightforward PAs I\u2019ve completed at WGU. It\u2019s not overwhelming if you stay organized. Glad to check this one off the list! I will update this post once I pass both tasks!","permalink":"\/r\/WGU\/comments\/1kgid8g\/d333_pa_submitted_both_tasks_in_1_day\/","created_utc":1746572327,"score":9,"text_length":1695,"vader_compound":0.9738,"course_code":"D333"}

{"post_id":"1khalss","subreddit":"wgu_devs","title":"Passed the new version of D335. Annoying proctor experience + tips for you","selftext":"First off, I had to do the exam twice. This was extremely annoying!!!! I got to question 15 and Zybooks froze. I was able to click everything else except buttons inside the Zybooks window. The proctor was no help( I guess he doesn\u2019t work for Zybooks so he wouldn\u2019t know anything). The proctor before this one was so sensitive about my camera angle, and claimed he couldn\u2019t connect to my computer even though the little window said connected and he left for some reason. Anyway, nothing worked so, turns out, I had to just retake the exam. Thank God I still passed!!! \n\n\nSecondly, there were 15 questions. And some of the questions, just like the Pre-Assessment, the question asked for one thing but the Zybooks test case is asking for something else. For example, the input statement is preloaded into the window, so Zybooks wrote this for you. It would say input(\u201cEnter your name\u201d). And then when you write your code and run the test case, it comes back and fail your code and tell you that you shouldn\u2019t have \u201center your name\u201d, you should have \u201center the name\u201d instead. Even though you did not write it, nor did the question asked you to alter it or write a particular thing. That made no sense. But thank God I could see the test case and correct anything that was off according to Zybooks and pass. \n\nNow to pass the exam: In a nutshell, make sure you know how to: \n\n1. Grab the index of a value in a list or grab the value using the index. list.index(value) \/ list[index] \n\n2. Know how to convert data types. Int(), str(), float(). \n\n3. Know how to read from a file, know how to write to a file. Know how to read from a csv. My CSV question asked me to print the last string in each line of strings in the file. I can show you how to do this if you don\u2019t know how. \n\n4. Know how to import modules, like math and using methods provided by math to calculate stuff. Like finding the square root- math.sqrt().. this question also required me to write code to determine if there was a perfect square when the square root was found, did not expect that at all \ud83d\ude02\n\n5. Know how to grab dictionary values. \n\n6. Know how to perform repeated inputs from the user. For example: if the user enters 3, know how to ask them for something 3 times since they entered 3.. feel me? \n\n7. Know how to grab the type of data type using type(). \n\n8. Know how to format strings, if it\u2019s two decimal places, if it\u2019s 1, if it\u2019s 3.. know how to output a number and make it have a certain amount of decimal places.\n\n9. Know how to use % and \/\/ combined to split numbers. Like a question asked me to split a 11 digit number(99887788990) into +9-988-778-8990. Zybooks teaches you to use % and \/\/ to do this. Also, % and \/\/ comes in handy in another question which I didn\u2019t answer because I just couldn\u2019t do it for some reason. So I definitely got 14\/15 or something. Anyway, the question asked me to find the days, hours and minutes given a certain amount of minutes. I\u2019m sure you use % or \/\/ to do that one but I just couldn\u2019t do it. The math wasn\u2019t clicking for me at the time \ud83e\udd23\n\n10. RUN YOUR CODE, TEST IT. THEN SUBMIT THE TEST CASES, CHECK IF ALL OF THEM PASSED, IF THEY DONT, FOLLOW THE FEEDBACK, EVEN IF ITS DIFFERENT FROM THE ACTUAL QUESTION AND YOU\u2019LL PASS. \n\nThey will probably fix the errors in Zybooks  or something by the time you take it, idk, but just in case they don\u2019t. Please check the test cases and the feedback before thinking you\u2019re all set. That\u2019s all I remember from the exam. Good luck! \n\n11. Do practice tests 2 labs in Zybooks, do the Pre-Assessment. If you can do both of these without ANY OUTSIDE HELP, you\u2019re ready for that OA!!!  That\u2019s all I used to pass and honestly, I had some coding experience but I couldn\u2019t use it to pass without doing some studying. \n","permalink":"\/r\/wgu_devs\/comments\/1khalss\/passed_the_new_version_of_d335_annoying_proctor\/","created_utc":1746657109,"score":42,"text_length":3824,"vader_compound":0.9956,"course_code":"D335"}

I then spent maybe about 2-3 hours or so to study up on these areas. I read all of chapter 9 in the course textbook, and then found the videos from the course resource index and watched everything they had which covered chapter 10. These two chapters covered the competencies which needed refining in my case. I found the quiz review videos pretty fun and helpful, though there was a lot of fluff which made them a slog to get through at times.\n\nAfter reviewing the questions I got incorrect on the PA again, I took the OA. I found the OA to be quite similar to the PA, with at least a couple questions being reused from the PA. Both the OA\/PA are intuitive.\n\nOne relevant tip from the professor can be paraphrased as \"if a question is soliciting a positively connotated answer (what would increase team cohesiveness most), look for an answer with a positive keyword, such as improving or strengthening, and vice versa.\" This is simple, and again, intuitive, but it's helpful for narrowing down the correct answer.

{"post_id":"1kk78dz","subreddit":"WGUCyberSecurity","title":"D485 - Cloud Security Passed","selftext":"Completed version DGN2 of the D485 - Cloud Security PA within 4 days. Here is my advice on how to complete this course!\n\nFirst, refer to [Complete the D485 Task in 5 days](https:\/\/srm--c.vf.force.com\/apex\/coursearticle?Id=kA0S60000001KntKAE). All of the resources I will be referencing can be found on the 5-day guide and Welcome Email. Please be sure to email your instructor for a copy of the welcome email if you don't receive it within the first 24 hours. It's also common for students to see an empty Course Tips section due to technical issues on WGU's end. The welcome email should include resources that would normally be found in the Course Tips.\n\nStep 1)\n\nDownload all of the necessary documents. That includes the Task Guide (docx), Task Template (docx), and Company Overview and Requirements (docx). All three of these are critical, and you will use them frequently. Immediately open the Task Template and begin updating the template to use for your Task submission.\n\nNext, start reading the task scenario, company overview and requirements document. I used a digital note-taking app to write down my thoughts and key points. I used Notion on MacOS, but OneNote is great on Windows. I also used Notion to store websites I visited for sources\/works cited.\n\nStep 2)\n\nFor sections A, B, F, and G, just about all you need is available directly within the Task scenario or \"Company Overview and Requirements\" document. Section A is all about summarizing SWBLT LLC, its challenges, and requirements. Section B is all about focusing on what Microsoft Azure service model works best for the scenario and their requirements. Section F is all about the risks assumed by Microsoft and SWBLT based on the Service Model you selected. What do both companies need to consider and take responsibility for. Section G is all about identifying threats that come naturally with your selected service model.\n\nStep 3)\n\nBefore you get started on the lab, take a look at the linked instructional videos and guided labs. There will be a few Microsoft Knowledge Articles on RBAC, Key Vaults, and Back-ups located in the Welcome Email. Make sure to look at those and prepare to refer to them for their respective sections.\n\nStep 4)\n\nFor section C, this is where most of us get tripped up. Don't fixate on all of the issues with the lab. You will see resources in the wrong resource groups, users with permissions they shouldn't have, etc... You won't be able to fix everything... no really, you won't. Some things will error out within the lab if you attempt them. Take that as a clue to stay within scope. The task simply wants you to identify three best practices for RBAC and implement those three best practices. Then, screenshot the lab to include date\/time to prove you made the changes. Within the Welcome Email, you'll find a link to a Microsoft RBAC Best Practices knowledge article - use this article as a compass for what you should do, then refer to the introduction videos in the welcome email on how to navigate the Azure lab. Remember to reference the requirements document and the \"Resources\" tab of the lab for what accounts you should be working with.\n\nStep 5)\n\nFor section D, you can either work with the Azure Key Vaults already there or build new ones. There is a Microsoft knowledge article that walks you through how to create them. I can't give you the answer on how Azure Key Vaults are used for encrypting data, but there are Microsoft Knowledge articles that will help answer that question! Make sure to reference and cite them.\n\nStep 6)\n\nFor section E, reference the company overview and requirements document. That will tell you what back-up policies the company is looking for and who should be managing the back-ups. For help with configuring the back-up policies in the lab, refer to the Microsoft Back-Up knowledge article within the Welcome Email.\n\nConclusion:\n\nMy paper was about 18 pages long, 2444 words. There isn't a length requirement for the paper. Make sure to include the exact number of recommendations, risks, threats, ect... that the rubric asks for in each section. The Task template should make organizing the paper really easy. It also helped to put sub-bullets underneath each screenshot to help explain what they were capturing. Lastly, don't think too hard on this one. Even with zero Azure experience, this is possible to learn and complete within a week!","permalink":"\/r\/WGUCyberSecurity\/comments\/1kk78dz\/d485_cloud_security_passed\/","created_utc":1746986745,"score":3,"text_length":4319,"vader_compound":0.9967,"course_code":"D485"}

Make sure you have familiarity with all of the listed calculations And the review the Boot Camp video. I would say that helped me the most. Dr. H\u2018s videos helped as well, but if you do those and the Boot Camp, you should be good. I did not read the book at all. A couple of things I remember from the test:\n1. They are going to ask you about 10 different ways in different scenarios on how to maximize share value. You just have to read each of the responses. How do you maximize shareholder value? By keeping the customers happy,keeping the shareholders happy, mitigating too much risk, and slowly increasing your profits and growth over time.\n2. The bond calculations were difficult for me because I forgot how to divide the rate and multiply the number of periods. I think I was just in information overload, especially when they give you the market rate and the discount rate and two different numbers. Listen closely on how to do the excels, they won\u2019t have the complete formula of how to calculate the rate if it\u2019s semi annual and the NPER, but I attended Lenora\u2018s online class and Dr.V boot camp helped a lot.\n3.

{"post_id":"1kluz5d","subreddit":"WGU","title":"I passed D335 - Introduction to Programming in Python in 18 days. Here's how I did it.","selftext":"Greetings, Night Owls. I passed D335 and I just wanted to share with all of you the resources and strategies I utilized to be successful in this course.\n\nThe first thing you'll want to do is log into Udemy and find the course \"100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp\" taught by Dr. Angela Yu. As a WGU student, you have FREE access to ALL of the content on Udemy if you log into the service with your WGU account credentials. Dr. Yu's course will be your main learning resource to succeed in D335. Dr. Yu's Udemy course consists of 100 days, but you will learn everything you need to know in order to pass the OA by Day 14 of the course.\n\nGo through each day of Dr. Yu's course up to Day 14 and complete all of the exercises and projects she assigns you to do. Additionally, read through a section of the Zybooks material made available to you in D335 after you complete Dr. Yu's daily videos and assignments. This will help with your understanding of the concepts covered in Dr. Yu's lessons. However, from my experience, the Participation Activities, Challenge Activities, and Labs contained within Zybooks goes way out of scope for the OA. I skipped that content in Zybooks, but you may complete that content if you so desire.\n\nAfter you've finished Day 14 of Dr. Yu's course, it's now time to attempt the Pre-Assessment. The Pre-Assessment is very similar to the OA. Both the Pre-Assessment and the OA consist of 15 questions and you only need to correctly answer 11 questions in order to pass. You should be able to pass the Pre-Assessment after having gone through Dr. Yu's course up to Day 14. But if you fail, that's fine. Simply identify the questions you got wrong, identify the skills those questions were asking of you, and then redo the days in Dr. Yu's course that covers the identified skills. However, if you pass the Pre-Assessment then you should be good to go for the OA.\n\nUsing the above resources and strategies, I passed the D335 OA in 18 days with a score of 13 out of 15 questions. If I can succeed in this course, then so can you! Just work hard and manage your time effectively. I believe in you, Night Owl!","permalink":"\/r\/WGU\/comments\/1kluz5d\/i_passed_d335_introduction_to_programming_in\/","created_utc":1747164492,"score":5,"text_length":2244,"vader_compound":0.9708,"course_code":"D335"}

{"post_id":"1kltnmm","subreddit":"WGU","title":"Is tier 1 my best option or do I need a new mentor?","selftext":"BSITM Major here, my mentor is usually pretty helpful. I had a slow start to the term (living situation issues). I know you can't ask for more when you haven't proven yourself, though, so I made sure to never ask for a new course until the current one was either finished or the PA was submitted.\n\nDue to my living situation, I couldn't dedicate much time to school, so I only got through 4 courses in the first 4 months, which I know discourages them from giving me more. However, I have since completed 12 courses, and it would've been 13, but the assessment services were going in and out over the past weekend, which made it impossible to take my OA. I transferred in 54CUs, and I only have 13 left once I am able to take my current courses OA.\n\nI am aware that I might be facing an impossible task, but I still want to try. Also, I haven't failed any OAs or had any PAs returned to me, so that hasn't been an issue yet. \n\nMy term ends May 31st, so I know I'm pushing it, but it seemed my mentor and I were able to come to an understanding after last week's call. We agreed on a deadline of the 15th for adding new courses, but then my mentor started taking much, much longer to add courses. Previously, they would've done so within 3 hours if I emailed them during their office hours, but then they started taking at least 24 hours to reply, which wouldn't be an issue if we hadn't agreed on a deadline.\n\n(Assessment services being out didn't help)\n\nToday, they directly told me they aren't moving up any other courses to this term, as the rest of the courses are too \"information-heavy\". Instead, they went ahead and scheduled me for the next term. They set the dates in the degree plan and signed me up for a term extension for the course I currently have (C234 Workforce Planning).\n\nI thought about requesting a new mentor, as that seems to be one of the best options, but I worry that I'll have the same exact issues with the next one, especially since I'm so close to the end of the term. I also don't know how long that process can take, and I'd prefer not to lose any more days if I don't have to.\n\n**Basically, I was wondering if it's possible to use tier 1 to accelerate my last few courses rather than go through the process of getting a new mentor, or do I need a new one to fix what my current one did?**\n\nAny help is appreciated! Let me know if you need more details as well.

Therefore, most of this exam was repeated knowledge for me. In case you don't know how this course works, you only need to pass the WGU exam to complete it. Upon completion, you can request a voucher to take the CCSP on your own, but it's not required for your degree. At least not for the BS in Cybersecurity. Personally, I'm planning to potentially *take* it after graduation.\n\nStudying:  \nAs I said before, most of this class is going to be repeated knowledge. I started by trying to work through that massive Quizlet, but I only ended up doing maybe 50 or so terms. I'm just not a Quizlet guy. After that, I watched the 8-hour-long WannaBeA CCSP Udemy course. You can use CCSP resources since the WGU exam is basically an easier CCSP exam. Not going to lie, I only gave the videos about half of my attention while watching. I was mostly on my phone and playing it in the background. After 'completing' the videos, I took the practice exam and passed. I reviewed what I got wrong and went straight into the OA and passed first try. There were a few questions where I had to guess but the OA was similar enough to the PA in terms of scope\/wording.\n\nConclusion:  \nIf you're taking this class late into your degree plan, you can probably just jump straight into the PA and see how you do. If you do well enough and are feeling ballsy, maybe just take the OA. In hindsight, that's probably what I would have done. There was very little new material here so late into my Cybersecurity program. I'm sorry if this write-up is a bit disappointing, but I really didn't have much to latch onto for this one. Good luck, and let me know if you have any questions.","permalink":"\/r\/WGU\/comments\/1knw1oq\/managing_cloud_security_d320_dans_guide\/","created_utc":1747385303,"score":1,"text_length":1897,"vader_compound":0.9231,"course_code":"D320"}

Every time I started studying, all I could hear was Charlie Brown's teacher, and soon I avoided studying and dreaded watching the videos. And the videos were SO confusing at first. \n\nAnyway, I didn't read any of the course material. For me it was just too dry. I finally buckled down and watched the videos and recorded cohorts three or four times through. I took the practice test at the very end of the course material and watched all the practice quiz videos. I used AI to help me understand some of the terms. Ok, all of them. lol\n\nHere's my advice: Watch the entire first set of videos all the way through and take notes. Then watch them again. Then go back and watch whichever ones you need to see again. The information might not make sense at first, but it will. For me it was like a puzzle, and each section was a piece. Repetition was key. \n\nOnce I went through all the videos a few times and read my notes, it started to click. Have google or AI fill in the blanks for any definitions you don't understand.\n\nThe OA was similar to the PA and had some challenging questions.

But generally they are useful to familiarize yourself about zybook and labs.\n\nPractice if you are familiar with python should take 2-3 days, if you aren't just take your time (2 weeks at least) this the most crucial step.\n\nFinally the most important tip, in the study material there are 2 practical test like PA, the second one it's exactly like PA, the OA is similar with few changes, so make sure you do this test and get yourself familiar with all questions.\nMost of the people know coding but still fail, cause they write it in wrong formatting, in zybook it must be same exact format, know how to use format string and read the output format in the task, you can write correct code and just mess up because of the correct format, know how to use decimal point in the format it's almost in every task.\n\nIn the test there is run test button in each question that you would know your code is correct or no, make sure you use it to make sure everything is correct.\n\nFor who are new to coding, it's like you learning new human language, you won't pick it up in few days and run, so take your time and it's ok to struggle this is part of your journey \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffb\n","permalink":"\/r\/WGU\/comments\/1l5kvxn\/d335_in_7_days_tips\/","created_utc":1749303012,"score":4,"text_length":2477,"vader_compound":0.8209,"course_code":"D335"}

I just finished this class and I wanted to create a guide discussing the resources and strategies I used to succeed in this class. I will say that this class really is as hard as everyone else says it is. Expect to put in substantial time and effort in this class. \n\nWhat you'll want to do is complete ALL of the Zybooks content including the challenge activities and the labs. Completing all of this content will solidify your understanding of the material you need to know for the OA.   \n  \nAdditionally, as you make daily progress in the Zybooks content, watch one video in Dr. Soper's Database Lessons playlist each day: [https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/playlist?list=PL1LIXLIF50uXWJ9alDSXClzNCMynac38g](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/playlist?list=PL1LIXLIF50uXWJ9alDSXClzNCMynac38g) . Watching one of these videos each day will also reinforce your understanding of the Zybooks content. \n\nFurthermore, I encourage you to also work through Colt Steele's MySQL course on Udemy to get more hands-on practice with MySQL: [https:\/\/wgu.udemy.com\/course\/the-ultimate-mysql-bootcamp-go-from-sql-beginner-to-expert\/](https:\/\/wgu.udemy.com\/course\/the-ultimate-mysql-bootcamp-go-from-sql-beginner-to-expert\/)\n\nAfter you've finished the Zybooks content, it is now time for you to attempt the Pre-Assessment. From my experience, the Pre-Assessment was similar to the OA in terms of difficulty. In other words, if you can pass the Pre-Assessment you should be good to go for the Objective Assessment.\n\nThat's all she wrote! While this class is difficult and challenging, what you'll need to do in order to succeed is pretty straightforward. Just complete the Zybooks content, watch Dr. Soper's videos, and practice MySQL in Colt Steele's bootcamp and you'll set yourself up for success on the Objective Assessment.

Most of the posts I\u2019ve seen seem a bit outdated, so I\u2019d love some fresh insights!\n\nHere are my main questions:\n\n1. **Favorite course?** Was there a class where you *really* learned a lot or gained useful tools you still use?\n2. **Least favorite course (or most difficult)?** Which course was the biggest struggle, least interesting, or in need of a major update? Feel free to rate all the courses if you\u2019re feeling generous. \ud83d\ude09\n3. **Tips for success?** Besides building my annotated bibliography as I go, do you have any other tips that helped you stay ahead or make things easier?\n4. **Group\/team course (C205?)** I\u2019ve read that you need to apply a month in advance to be placed in a team. Can someone walk me through how that worked for them? I\u2019m a little anxious about group work and want to know what to expect. \n5. **How long did it take you to finish?** I have a solid background in leadership and plan to accelerate through the program. I do better with papers (PA tasks) than with objective assessments. Even when I study a ton and do well on practice quizzes, I still feel unsure going into exams. Just curious how long others took and what worked best for them. I recently completed my BS degree through WGU so I am familiar with the school but the layout\/format\/course material is set up differently for this program than my BS was. \n\n**Bonus question\/comment:**  \nI write all my own papers and typically score a 90\u201393% in Grammarly upon initial upload. But when I check the AI detection tab, it still highlights about 10 spots as potentially AI-generated. Sometimes fixing Grammarly\u2019s suggestions even increases that number. \ud83d\ude29 When I upload to WGU\u2019s submission portal, my similarity score is always under 5%. Is this normal?

And they didn\u2019t put any cash flow questions on my test which I was also surprised about. The test seemed to be more focused on understand the concepts of the material more than the application of it. \n\nLastly, do not skip on learning the terminology. Study the meaning and the application of all the words associated with the course. They will ask you, in one way or another, what each word means. \n\nAll in all it wasn\u2019t a hard class like everyone says it was. Just a lot of information. Take your time and don\u2019t feel like you have to rush through the material to accelerate. Even though I\u2019m accelerating, I took my time on this class. Cheers.

{"post_id":"1l0aj2j","subreddit":"WGU","title":"Don\u2019t give up\u2014 I made it by the skin of my teeth","selftext":"The first month of my term started strong, I knocked out an orientation and an OA\u2014 and then\u2026. my partner suddenly lost his ability to walk. Over the next two months, he rapidly deteriorated due to what was shortly after diagnosed as an aggressive autoimmune disease. \n\nFor the first four months of this term, I was barely functioning outside of being a full time caregiver and hospital advocate. At one point, I was also admitted for a few days, and when It all started to settle down a month ago\u2014 I thought I was too far behind to recover.\n\nBut I decided to try.\n\nI did the classes that I was most confident with first, and saved the more technical classes for last. I only got through one class that first week and then barely had time to study these last two weeks\u2026 but my love\u2019s health has stabilized, and this week: I locked in. \n\nNow, In the last 36 hours, I passed my last three Objective Assessments. \ud83d\ude2d \nIt\u2019s a reminder that: \n###if you still have any amount of time left\u2014 you still have a shot.\n\nI didn\u2019t do it by reading every chapter, I did it by stripping everything down to basics and using shortcuts like: \n1. Seeing what the course objectives were and focusing on that content\n2. Cohort videos\n3. Having pages be read aloud while I read them and writing things down to make sure my brain would take it in. I asked copilot for glossary-style explanations of every concept and if something didn\u2019t stick, I asked it:  \u201cExplain it like I\u2019m 10\u201d.\n\nIn summary, some days I made progress. Some days I couldn\u2019t function.\nBut I kept coming back.\nAnd with one day left in the term, I submitted my final assessment for a class that I thought there was no way I was passing- sleep deprived and only 5 hours familiar with the material. (C955 Statistics and Probability) I finished at 9am on no no sleep and with only 3 minutes left on the timer..\n\nBut I passed \ud83d\ude2d \n\nTo anyone feeling too far behind:\nYou don\u2019t need a perfect plan\u2014you just need to continue to step forward.

{"post_id":"1kyucuu","subreddit":"WGU","title":"IT Capstone Written Project - C769 (Dan's Guide)","selftext":"Start Date\/End Date: 5\/19-5\/23  \nTask Time: 15-20 Hours\n\nOverview:  \nThis is it, the final course in the Cybersecurity Program! The essence of this course is that you need to create an IT-related solution to a problem for a business that *you* come up with. Think of this like C843 - Managing Information Security, or any of the other courses where you had to analyze a case study and then create a solution to the problems presented. The difference here is that you're basically creating both the case study AND the solution. The key is to keep it simple, but still broad enough that you can write a lot about your topic. Make it about something you understand and don't get too hung up on the technical details. You can write about anything, really. Here are some ideas I had that I didn't use: \n\n* Implementation of a Mobile Device Management (MDM) Solution.\n* A business begins taking Credit Cards as a payment method and must comply with PCI-DSS.\n* A business conducts an anti-phishing \/ user awareness training campaign.\n* Implementation of Multi-Factor Authentication.\n* Implementation of Firewalls and other network hardening solutions.\n\nIf you're struggling to come up with an idea, you can meet with your instructor or ask ChatGPT something like: \"Give me an idea for a final project as a student majoring in cybersecurity where I have to create an IT-related solution for a business.\" I don't endorse using ChatGPT to write the project for you, but it's a good resource to help give you ideas. I wrote my project about implementing a multitude of smaller solutions in response to a penetration test to create defense-in-depth.\n\nTask 1:  \nThis task is very straightforward. Download the template and fill it out as it pertains to your idea. All you're really doing here is brainstorming. You only need to write a couple of sentences\/bullet points in response to each part. When you're done, email this form to your course instructor so they can sign off on it. Once they send you the signed version, submit that for task 1, and you'll pass.\n\nTask 2:  \nThis is easily the most time-consuming task. In the present tense, you're going to talk about each of the following points. This one took me about 8-10 hours.  \nSection A:   \nProvide a good overview of the situation, your solution, and how it will be implemented. This was the longest section in my submission. Make sure you provide context for the situation. How large is your organization? What incentivized this solution? Why is this solution proper? You don't need to go too into detail here, but you do have to provide a lot of context. Think of this whole section like you're writing the case study.  \nSection B:   \nFind trusted resources that support your solution. For example, if you're adding MFA, find an article that explains why it's effective. Briefly summarize those articles and hold onto the links for your work cited at the end.  \nSection C:   \nThis is where you're going to notice how much you have to repeat yourself. This is very similar to what was asked of you in A3. Just discuss why your solution is needed and the repercussions if it isn't done.  \nSection D:   \nIn this section, talk about how this will benefit the organization on a more personal level. For example, if you're improving the security of an organization that possesses PII, discuss how important it is for that information to remain confidential.  \nSection E:   \nI had to revise my first submission because of this. You need to mention a methodology such as waterfall, agile, ADIDE, ect.   \nSection F:   \nThis part is all about wording and really breaking things down. \"Goals, objectives, and deliverables\" are all synonyms of one another, so it gets a bit convoluted. In this context, think of it like this. Goals = What you want to do (ex, \"Create a strong password policy\"). Objectives = What this solution will actually accomplish (ex, \"Reduce the likelihood\/success of brute force attacks\"). Deliverable = What will physically be done and by whom to accomplish this (ex, \"Create a system where IT administration is responsible for the creation of a strong password policy within Windows Active Directory\").  \nSection G:  \nThis is straightforward. Just put some dates in and what you want to have accomplished by those dates. Put them at any point in the future.  \nPart H: Discuss how you'll know your solution was effective. Include a measurable way to determine this. This could be something like a penetration test if you created a security-related solution.\n\nTask 3:  \nA lot of this task is repeating information from task 2, just by rewording it and discussing it in the past tense. For a couple of sections here, I literally copied and pasted what I wrote in task 2 and just reworded it. Because of this, I'm only going to break down the sections that are different.   \nSection F:   \nI changed my dates to be in the past for this part. It doesn't have to be consistent with the dates from Task 2 Section G. I said that my solution was not implemented by the expected date due to scope creep. This transitioned well into section G.  \nSection G:  \nTalk about something that you may not have considered and, in turn, took more time. For example, maybe updating the operating system on a workstation will make a business essential application no longer compatible. It doesn't have to be true, just a realistic issue.  \nSection I:  \nFor this part, include photos that show your solution at work. For example, if you created a password policy, show a before-and-after screenshot of it in Windows Active Directory. Or if you added a firewall, show a screenshot of its configuration.

I posted previously about the \"to-do\" list because it was a generic, canned email with generic \"you did poorly in all the parts, this is how to get better\" when I was exemplary in more than one part of the OA. It appears to be the same email everyone who fails the OA gets, whether you fail by 1 question, or only get 1 question right.\n\nI emailed the instructor last week, automated response of \"we'll get to your email in the order it was received\", waited until yesterday and emailed the whole instructor team, no response. Given the end of my term is in 3 days, I spoke to my mentor and they said I would probably fail the course but my average is good so I won't suffer any serious consequences for it. I'm just frustrated I spent so much time to go through the academic hazing for failing over 3-4 questions over the past 2 weeks just to sit and wait for the fail to happen.\n\nEven if it is approved for a retake tomorrow or the next day, I doubt I will get a decent appointment time with a a proctor given my work schedule this week.

I email my provided instructor constantly, and receive special study guides, and feedback that aren't provided in the course. This is EXTREMELY helpful. Don't be embarrassed, if you need help then you need help. Ask and you shall receive. \n\n- Memorize the glossary. The glossary makes up majority of the tests for each course. Find the glossary, print it out if you can, make a Quizlet, and go to town on learning this. \n\n- I don't personally talk to my mentor that often and you don't have to unless you really need to. \n\n- Get a schedule!! I unexpectedly lost my job the week I was starting school and my whole world was turned around with uncertainties and a new schedule. I'm just now getting in the grind of focusing on school. You have to focus, you can't do a little here and there. You HAVE to focus. Lock in. \n\n- try to pass exams the first time. Again, I wasn't focused due to life events and I thought doing \"a little here and a little there\" is enough to get by. I did not pass D072 the first time by just a few questions. Those few questions and not locking in cost me 3 extra weeks of study time and proving to my professors that I can retake the exam. Just try and pass the first time and save yourself this headache. You have to prove to them that you can retake this, they WILL NOT let you otherwise. \n\n- Make your own quizlets. This will help you adapt to the knowledge better because you're the one making it, and many other people's quizlets I have found are outdated or are incomplete. \n\n----\n\nJust a few tips from a (still) newbie to a future newbie, I would like to continue documenting my journey through WGU's accounting courses. \n\nPlease let me know any comments anyone has!

{"post_id":"1kxgk8n","subreddit":"WGU","title":"D336 - Study Materials & Experience - Less than 1 Week","selftext":"Wanted to share what worked for me as I found this material really boring and convoluted. So if you're like me, maybe you'll find these helpful, too.\n\n\n\nStarted with **Jason Dion's** [**Introduction to Service Management with ITIL 4**](https:\/\/wgu.udemy.com\/course\/service-management-itil-4\/?kw=ITIL+4&src=sac) **video on UDemy** as a toe dipper, but be warned this doesn't cover even half the material. Just gives you a taste of the lingo and mindset for the material.\n\n\n\nAfter scrolling PeopleCert's study materials, I realized it was all designed to be a presentation. They literally just give you slides with a bunch of fluff around the frame. So after a lot of digging for one of these such presentations, I found [**ITIL\u00ae 4 Foundation Virtual Training Roadmap**](https:\/\/youtu.be\/NeR_U3oJVkM?si=oG-Axdk_ObHTnoLR) **| Led by Vishal Vyas | Presented by Knowlathon on Youtube** which was absolutely the meat and potatoes of my study materials. He's well versed in explaining the concepts instead of just regurgitating the slides which is how the material was designed to be learned (Be warned his accent is thick - adjust video speed accordingly).\n\n\n\nAfter taking extensive hand written notes (typing this stuff just wasn't working for me), **I reviewed the ITIL 4 Cram Card shared with me by my instructor.** \n\n  \n  \nAnything I didn't recognize or recall, I asked **ChatGPT\\* to \"*****Define and explain \\_\\_\\_\\_ in terms of ITIL 4*****\"** then fleshed out any missing areas of my knowledge from there as most of what was missing were smaller sections of vocab that once defined made sense - mostly. Again, hand written notes.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, I hand drew the major diagrams while watching Vishal's presentation. He walks you through it and how the diagrams are meant to read. They're intended to be a sort of 3D model, but in 2D they're very confusing until it clicks. Once you realize someone got paid way too much to over engineer these graphics, it'll be less intimidating.\n\n\n\nI then took all of the major concepts and my notes, and recreated everything in **Quizlet under a folder called D336,** [**link to my study materials**](https:\/\/quizlet.com\/user\/Star_Gayzer\/folders\/d-336)**.** I found the **Test\\*\\* feature** the most helpful in addition to starting with the definitions first, then the terms. Term then definition did not work for me. I always set the test to give immediate feedback and reviewed everything. Granted my cards are not exhaustive, but I tried to keep the word ing very close to the actual definition. I think it's important to familiarize yourself with the trigger words ITIL 4 uses to associate definitions with their vocab. For example, they like to use *ensure* when referring to a *management* concept etc. Not always true, but true most of the time. Additionally, I preferred using Quizlet on the mobile app for studying while editing in browser is MUCH better.\n\nI did take [**Jason Dion's ITIL\u00ae 4 Foundation Practice Exams**](https:\/\/wgu.udemy.com\/course\/itil-4-foundation-practice-certification-exams-6-exams-q\/) **(only 1 and 2)** to get a feel for the style of questions. I only passed them with a 70% before cramming my Quizlet Tests instead with immediate feedback on.\n\n\n\n**After 3 days of cramming, I passed as an unconfident test taker with a 88%**\n\n\n\nI'm sure if you used this method with proper study pacing and more thoroughness, these resources would do you well.\n\n\n\n***\\*****I pay for ChatGPT so my results may be different from yours if you are using the limited free version. However, I found ChatGPT GPT-4o is effective at exact definition recall for ITIL 4 terminology, and is decent at providing reasonable examples to assist with confusing topics. Also made copying and pasting into Quizlet a lot easier than hand typing everything out.*\n\n\n\n***\\*\\*****Test feature has limited uses on free version so I bought 1 month of Quizlet to take as many Tests as I wanted.*","permalink":"\/r\/WGU\/comments\/1kxgk8n\/d336_study_materials_experience_less_than_1_week\/","created_utc":1748437481,"score":1,"text_length":3506,"vader_compound":0.9936,"course_code":"D336"}
{"post_id":"1kxjfz1","subreddit":"WGU","title":"D777","selftext":"I spent too much time on these 2 tasks, but what really helped me is that I am currently unemployed. I did a lot of Leetcode before, but unfortunately, it was in Java, not Python. My knowledge was fundamental from my bachelor's in Software Engineering. That said, Python's been the easiest language to pick up and understand.\n\nTask I\n\nThe rubric is self-explanatory. What helped me was understanding DSA. I did have an understanding, but it was not at an expert level. I signed up for a course on Udemy by Scott Barret: Python Data Structures & Algorithms to help me brush up on these. You don't need to know everything; you just need a basic understanding of how data structures work, how they access\/move\/delete the elements, and what time and space complexity it involves(harder for some DSA than others).\n\nYou choose the DSA that will best align with the task and the business requirements depending on what you want your system to accomplish; you explain the pros\/cons, tradeoffs, and best use cases by evaluating the type of data, Big O, and functionality to meet the business requirements. There's a part that says it must be supported by empirical data or theoretical analysis(test conducted). Researching this was the most time-consuming.\n\nYou also have to look into understanding the reliability of the data structures; for example, what happens if the system crashes and you're in the middle of a queued item for delivery? How will you restore order to the queue? Can you save the current state of the application and reload it? Those are things to think about.\n\nThere is this last part, which I think was extremely helpful for me since I didn't know much about Python; you have to choose and research some libraries\/modules that will best fit the problem you are trying to solve, then explain the relevancy, application efficiency, etc. of why these are the best for the what the business needs.\n\n\n\nTask II\n\nThis is what you previously talked about in Task I; I did not 100% stay in line with Task I because planning and execution are totally different, lol.\n\nThe first part is self-explanatory. Clone the repo. Find out what operations you need to meet the business requirements, write these functions, and discuss why you chose them. Then, test them for input, error handling, and edge cases. Lastly, create the ReadMe file.\n\nMy project was unnecessarily complex. I built a Warehouse Management System that uses queues, priority queues, dicts, lists, and graphs; if you want to check the box, make a simple system using 2 data structures as it says in the rubric.\n\nMy System Structure:\n\nThis is the part I got confused about the most. I had to redo the structure 3 times because I needed to nest specific metadata into the dicts and reverse map products with SKU; I mean to make the system more optimizable using dicts at Big O(1) access\/update\/lookup, etc. I needed this(this was my first time building something like this). But using this introduces bugs and silent errors like I've never experienced. \n\nThe warehousing system includes 4 warehouses and a distribution center(Graph-Edge& Nodes). Each warehouse has an aisle and bin(Edge & Node) system to track item placement\/extraction and path finding of items within the warehouse. Each bin(aisle, bin->list of bins) has SKUs and a maximum amount preloaded to test the data.\n\nRestock\/Order  & Access Updates : \n\nThe Distribution Center receives an order request\/restock request(queue\/deque).Check for existence. Verifies across bins to verify we can fulfill, extract if we can by pathfinding, and fill the truck with the maximum amount available in the queue. Find the optimal or shortest delivery path with current items(Dijkstra's algo & TSP). Continue the delivery process until the queue has been cleared.\n\nThis is done by looking up SKU info in the current warehouse and then the delivery warehouse; we must constantly find the SKU info(inside the available inventory of each warehouse) to do checks. I'm sure there are better ways to do this, but this was the one I understood best and was fast enough for me.\n\nWarehouse Space Optimization & Scalability:\n\nBin overflow management, finding optimization of bins by finding bins with duplicate SKUs spread across the warehouse, bin usage reports, auto-assign bins of products(existing or new), pathfinding within the warehouse, etc. functions.\n\nadd\/remove\/ nodes and edges as well as make adjustments to cost. NetworkX and matplotlib(display)\n\nFault Tolerance :\n\nSaved snapshot of the current state of the application every couple of minutes, auto-save, auto-load, and error handling when needed.\n\nThere is a lot more to the system, but having these in mind helped me the most. The crucial part is managing the updates across the different structures if you consider doing a project like this. Hope this helps.","permalink":"\/r\/WGU\/comments\/1kxjfz1\/d777\/","created_utc":1748444726,"score":2,"text_length":4827,"vader_compound":0.9986,"course_code":"D777"}

If I got to a problem I didnt understand, I'd find a problem that was similar in the video and rewatch that piece.\n\n-At the end of the module video, I'd take at least one problem set within mindedge AND the module test. I did this for every module, even though the first two modules are not on the test.\n\n-Took the PA. Repeated steps above (with new practice problem sets) for the areas I was lacking\n\n-Took the OA. Passed higher than I ever expected. Cried a little. Moving on \ud83e\udd23\n\nTips:\n\n-I can't remember where I heard it, but there is a video in the course that mentions \"no one is BAD at math. They're only lacking practice\" and that mindset really helped me get over that initial lump of fear and get started in the course\n\n-Take your time. If you need to go back through the video, do it. If you need more practice problems, do them. I have pages and pages of scratch paper with slope equation problems written all over it because I needed that much practice to \"get it\".\n\n-I found the OA to be harder. The questions in the PA were more focused on the beginning of the section material, while the OA was more focused on the deeper\/more complex details of the material. Definitely make sure you have a solid understanding of Module 7.\n\n-LEARN YOUR CALCULATOR. It's embarrassing to admit, but I had no clue that you could plug in fractions as-is into a calculator. Get the exact calculator they recommend - $20 at target. This way, you can follow along with the instructor when she goes through the problem on the calculator. There's a whole section (in mod 2 I think) that goes through calculator tips.\n\n-Buy your own whiteboard. No scratch paper on the OA and the whiteboard WGU sends is awful. When taking the OA, make sure you have your whiteboard eraser too, as I had to erase to make space during the test.\n\nYou got this!","permalink":"\/r\/WGU\/comments\/1kwrpfa\/passing_c955_applied_statistics_as_someone_who\/","created_utc":1748363272,"score":63,"text_length":2687,"vader_compound":-0.9728,"course_code":"C955"}

{"post_id":"1kw8mhm","subreddit":"WGU","title":"How I passed D388 Fundamentals of Spreadsheets and Data Presentations","selftext":"Hello WGU peers, I thought I would share how I passed this class to hopefully help others do the same. For context, I have minimal experience\/training with spreadsheets, I only have general computer literacy. Here's how:\n\n1. I actually didn't take the practice assessment for this class. I wouldn't recommend taking it off the bat either unless you already have a decent background in spreadsheets. You'll probably have to look into the course introduction to learn how to install the add-in to take the practice assessment and eventually the high-stakes assessment.\n\n2. Go through all of the course materials if you're starting from scratch. No secret sauce here. Fortunately, it doesn't take that long at all to get through them. There are 3 sections, each with 4-5 sub sections, each sub section with maybe 2-3 lessons to go through. Whenever there is a section with a video, just watch the video and that will suffice. There are a couple pages you might have to read through, but not many. The videos are pretty mid quality, but it is enough to get the job done. I wouldn't download any of the course materials they offer, instead just take the end of chapter test for each section. Those are the links which you paste inside of the add-on in excel. \n\n3. Take the PA after finishing the course materials. You'll have learned everything at this point, and now you get the chance to apply it all comprehensively. \n\n4. Take the OA. PA and OA were extremely similar in my experience. I will say I had about an hour worth of technical difficulties with how this exam is proctored, so factor in some time for that. As long as you went through the course materials and scored well on the PA, you will pass. You'll inevitably get docked points for dumb little things, like not sizing columns correctly (holy crap this is frustrating), or perhaps getting the correct answer using a different method than expected, but these point deductions are pretty minimal and shouldn't jeopardize your chances of passing. \n\nI completed this course in four days, starting from scratch. I'm not a crazy academic or anything, so if I can do it then you certainly can. Spend the <5-10 hours or so it takes to go through the course materials and go pass that class!","permalink":"\/r\/WGU\/comments\/1kw8mhm\/how_i_passed_d388_fundamentals_of_spreadsheets\/","created_utc":1748301706,"score":10,"text_length":2322,"vader_compound":0.9279,"course_code":"D388"}
{"post_id":"1kw894s","subreddit":"WGU","title":"How I passed D072 Fundamentals for Success in Business","selftext":"Sharing my experience with this class to hopefully assist my peers with passing as well. \n\n1. Take the PA before going into the course materials to gauge your current knowledge. Some of the competencies are intuitive, while others require knowledge of certain definitions. \n\n2. Be sure to study up on where you're lacking. Certain definition-based items that are key to know include the competing values framework (CVF), leadership styles (autocratic, participative, etc), communication styles (assertive\/aggressive, lean vs. rich), etc. I would look at other reddit posts to see what else people recommend to study as well. \n\n3. I personally studied using ChatGPT because I like being able to ask for examples and having items I don't understand clarified directly through a follow-up prompt. For example, the AI used amazon as an example for a company with a market culture and google as one with a clan culture. I personally didn't touch the course materials, but that may or may not be your style.\n\n4. Take the PA one last time to solidify what you've studied.\n\n5. Take the OA. You've got a good shot at passing at this point if you've gone through the previous steps. OA and PA are similar, OA being a bit more practical in applying definitions than the PA. There may be a question or two that you didn't study up on, but the vast majority should be familiar at this point. Fairly intuitive exam, especially the ethics and emotional intelligence sections. Otherwise, make sure you remember your definitions and how to apply them. \n\nThis isn't a class worth stressing over. I'm not a crazy academic, so if I passed, then you definitely can.

{"post_id":"1kw325m","subreddit":"WGU","title":"How to prepare before my start date?","selftext":"I am currently going through the enrollment process for the Bachelor of Science, Accounting program, with a tentative start date of July 1, 2025. I had a couple unsuccessful attempts at college 10+ years ago, with some AW\u2019s and F\u2019s on my transcripts due to some unfortunate personal circumstances and sheer irresponsibility. I ended up with only 9 credit hours and a cumulative GPA of 3.0. None of those hours will transfer to WGU, which I\u2019m fine with, as starting with a clean slate seems to be the best option in my situation. At 31 years old, I\u2019m a completely different person than I was from 18-21, so I enrolled in WGU Academy and took D072 to increase my chances of acceptance. I passed that class with flying colors in 3 1\/2 days, studying a couple hours each night after I put my kids to bed. I\u2019m ready to jump head first into more classes, but that\u2019s not gonna be in the cards for me. Yesterday I met with my WGU Academy Student Success Coach, and she informed me that I couldn\u2019t move my start date up to June 1 due to missing some deadlines for that start date. My question for you all is, is there anything productive I can do for the next three weeks (Coach stated they should open up orientation for me around June 15) to prepare for the rest of the first term Accounting classes? I\u2019ve already completed 24-25 and 25-26 FAFSA, done my MPN and loan counseling, requested prior transcripts and confirmed their delivery, and I\u2019d rather use this time to prepare than just sitting around until I can start orientation.

{"post_id":"1kvzaw3","subreddit":"WGU","title":"D080 - In 3-4 days","selftext":"Like most of my classes, I started this at the beginning of the term (as in I clicked Begin Course) and didn't look at it until I was 10 days away from the term ending. D080 was the last 3 CU's I needed to make the 12 minimum. \n\n**Unlike any other class at WGU:** There isn't a good Course Resource Page. *There is one, but it's just empty.* There are NO recorded co-horts, and if there are - they're well hidden. Lastly, you have to really dig around to find the videos that are available in lieu of co-horts. I was able to find a helpful page (see TOPIC VIDEO image) and was smart enough to save it as a PDF - because a few days later it was taken down, yet the links still worked.\n\nEnough complaining... Did the class over the span of 3.5 days.\n\n* **Day 1**: Units 1 & 2 (few hours - not extensive)\n* **Day 2:** Unit 3 and videos from units 2 & 3 (4 hours)\n* **Day 3:** Units 4, 5\\*, and 6\\* (about 6 hours during the day), PA around 10pm (50 minutes)\n   * **\\***= didn't read much, just did quizzes & watched videos and studied where I missed it.\n* **Day 4:** 2-hour quick review & OA (1 hour) - passed first attempt. (Yay)\n\n**Tips:** Read, Speed-read, or have your computer read them to you - but **read Units 2-4**. Seriously. Do those 3 units! Watch the videos, take the unit practice tests. You'll thank yourself later. (Any part of the course material where it said \"Watch this video\" I did. I did skip any part where it asked me to read something that open in a new window.)\n\n**PA vs OA:** Questions on the OA are very similar to the PA... however, the answers are a little more difficult to choose from. A lot of times more than one sounds right, and I just had to pick the one that applies the best, or simplest. Notice that I did better on the PA than the OA but still had a similar spread of competencies. The global practices answers were harder to decipher.\n\n(On subjective or ethical questions - If I've narrowed it down to two answers that are good, I choose the most liberal of the two.) \n\nOne more tip... It'll be a struggle - but watch the Topic Videos from the course instructors. (If you can find them.) All of the video presentations are mediocre, but they're helpful. One of them sounds like she's whispering the whole time, another one will pop your speakers the way her audio spikes, and there's one who can probably manage to make cocaine and birthday cake sound dull.\n\n[D080 Video list Holy Grail](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/lo341okxj53f1.png?width=715&format=png&auto=webp&s=7900fd2fff0c9d94cf70d4676ce9a6fd50ec0177)\n\n[OA Attempt 1](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/ob87ygzji53f1.png?width=846&format=png&auto=webp&s=417fd71a8a4e19b6f3bb232e1be563ba347784aa)\n\n[PA - Attempt 1](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/3ds9vkzji53f1.png?width=846&format=png&auto=webp&s=04fc6aff5aa05b1705884e035772bec52767e936)\n\n","permalink":"\/r\/WGU\/comments\/1kvzaw3\/d080_in_34_days\/","created_utc":1748278367,"score":1,"text_length":2420,"vader_compound":0.9833,"course_code":"D080"}

{"post_id":"1ktzheu","subreddit":"WGU","title":"Pythons for IT Automation D522- I Passed!!!!","selftext":"I wanted to make this post, as I have shed a lot of tears over this class. I didn\u2019t even cry for CompTIA as much as I did for this class. I felt inadequate and second guessing if I had what it takes to finish my degree. After failing 2 attempts by just a point, I had to go back and start over. Here\u2019s what helped me and I hope this helps others. \n\nTo preface I work FT and go to school FT, I want to encourage all you who is taking this class to not give up.\n\nMy husband found a class on edX, it\u2019s a free Harvard class called CS50 Intro to Python. He saw me shed too many tears and thank God looked up how to study for Python and edX came on his search. Now this may seem counterproductive to D522, but the instructor went over everything, it\u2019s a self pace class, and each section that is covered in D522 is there, and he goes over a lot of examples and teaches how to understand writing the code and be confident and comfortable. At the end of each section there\u2019s 5 questions to try and the format is a lot like the zyBooks coding questions and how it\u2019s worded. Since it\u2019s a pre-recorded class, you get to hear the other students questions and the some fo them are questions I had. You can join the class, it ends Dec 31st 2025. Here is the link to join the class: [https:\/\/www.edx.org\/learn\/python\/harvard-university-cs50-s-introduction-to-programming-with-python](https:\/\/www.edx.org\/learn\/python\/harvard-university-cs50-s-introduction-to-programming-with-python) \n\n  \nThe Help Webex by one of the instructors helped me answer 2 of the coding questions, so I would HIGHLY recommend watching that video. This video teaches how to use the help().\n\nThe zyBooks, went through the book, but I felt like I learned more through the Harvard class. I would recommend going over the 10 coding questions at the end and having ChatGPT create variations of the coding questions. I studied everyday for 2 weeks to take my 3rd attempt. I passed the threshold to pass. \n\nThe OA is like the PA, but a variation of it, so if a question focused on the concept, the OA might focus on applying the concept that it was asking you in the PA.\n\nI know there isn\u2019t much material and there is more focus on the other classes when it comes to understanding the material. But please don\u2019t give up, it is possible to pass the class. I studied for two weeks and took my 3rd attempt this morning before work. If I can do it, and I don\u2019t have industry experience, you can. I am almost at the end of my degree, and I know for a lot of people this class comes closer to the end. One thing hat helped me was praying, studying, and reminding myself I\u2019ve come this far in my degree to give up now. Lock in and finish, this class isn\u2019t going to get the best of you. And it didn\u2019t for me. Hopefully this encourages someone. If you follow what I shared and you\u2019re on your first attempt, it should lead you to pass. But one thing you can\u2019t skip over is practicing actually coding, which is where the Harvard class comes. \n\nOne last tip for coding practicing: I recommend using Pycharm as the program can finish the coding you were thinking of writing. That helped me become comfortable with coding and more confident and helped me understand why a code was written that way, or why the program chose that option to solve the coding. \n\nThat is all. Hopefully this helped. Again, you all have it in you to succeed and pass this class, it may not seem like it, but believe it, have faith that you can pass, study, and you will pass.

{"post_id":"1kttgws","subreddit":"WGU","title":"A little rant about C182","selftext":"This is first class that I have felt genuienly angry and upset about and I just want to rant to fellow Owls who probably understand my frustrations.   \n  \nMy goal is to complete my degree in a year, I have spent a week to a week and a half on each class with no issues. I am 73% through my program with having only failed two other OAs but passed on the 2nd try. There are personal and financial reasons for my deadline and I plan to complete my degree at the end of August, which is approaching.   \n  \nI failed Intro to IT - C182 OA TWICE and had been stuck on it for almost a month. I truly thought I passed it the first time, so I was sad but I follow the 2nd retake plan and get approval to retake again. Failed by probably ONE question. I get a generic email about the dreaded 3rd retake plan, something that I truly didn't have the patience for.   \n  \nThere was a lot of built up stress at this point, I had gotten some frightening news about my partner then I had woken up to an email with an extensive 3rd retake plan. Something that would actually take me about two days, but because the CI wanted me to meet with them 2-4 times and they only have availablity 5-7 days out it could be at least 2 weeks before I get approval. I was already falling behind, and I didn't have that kind of time.   \n  \nI kindly explained my situation in the email saying that I am a fast worker and I do have a deadline for myself. I'd like to retest as soon as next friday (which would be one week). If anyone would be willing to have a short phone call about this, that would be great. I gave my availability and sent it. I didn't get an email back until Monday morning. They disregarded my ENTIRE email, and sent another generic response basically saying that \"students who complete the 3rd retake plan to completion have a higher success rate of passing\". Okay, fine. I do what they ask cause I would be wasting more time being upset over it.   \n  \nI complete the study companions which there was 8 within the day. Took me about 5-6 hours then I send them to the group IT instructor email and schedule an appointment with an instructor to review them over the phone and send me the next step of the retake plan. The soonest appointment was Friday which was when I originally wanted to retake it, but I was also working on a seperate class that could fill in the gaps for the week (which I ended up passing that thursday). So come friday, I am sitting by my phone waiting for the phone call which I was supposed to recieve at 4:15 pm. Never got a phone call, not even email saying \"I'm sorry I missed your appointment\". I waited until 4:45 pm, before I sent an email explaining what happened and that I was extremely frustrated at this point.   \n  \nI don't get a response until Sunday morning from a different instructor saying they were sorry and would like to call me sometime that day between 2pm and 6pm. I wrote back instantly, saying yes of course, thank you for reaching out. I'll look forward to your call. Never got one. I wrote another email at about 6:30 pm explaining that I never got a call and that I am hoping someone can work with me in the morning. I recieve an email early Monday morning asking for my availablity so that a CI can reach out. I respond, and finally within a couple hours I recieve my phone call. It took not even 5 minutes for him to say, \"yep, your study sheets look good. I'm gonna send you the practice exam, get an 85% or higher then we will move to the final step before you can request approval.\" He was honestly very kind, I have no complaints about him, I just thougt it was funny that I could have easily had this done friday had the previous instructor I had an appointment with called me. \n\nAnyway, since I finally had someone on the phone, I briefly explained the situation to him and that I'd like to meet with someone ASAP and not wait another week for a phonecall. He understood and said I could schedule directly with him, he had availability all week. I was very gracious. He sent me the practice exam, and I got a 90% on it, then I was able to schedule a meeting with him the next day. I passed the knowledge check with him, then got approval from my instructor to retake it. Finally, after days of frustration, I retake and pass on my third try. \n\nThis class is difficult as someone who understands basic computing and it does not feel \"introductory\" at all. The book lacks so much material, it should be much more indepth that it is. All around not a very well structured course. And there definitely needs to be better communication between students and instructors because I've seen many other students complain about it as well. My tips would be to complete the study companions entirely, that helps apply the knowledge from the book then take all the comprehensive reviews in the learning resource hub, that's what helped me the most on the 3rd time around. Do not soley use the book, it will not help you succeed in my opinion. I didn't use any of the recorded cohorts, they felt unorganized IMO. But the other review sheets provided were helpful as well and google was also helpful in explaning some other topics that weren't explained well enough in the book. \n\nThat's all rant over. Has anyone else had poor communications with course instructors like that? This was the first time in the whole 9 months I've been doing school. Im curious. \n\n\n\n\n\n","permalink":"\/r\/WGU\/comments\/1kttgws\/a_little_rant_about_c182\/","created_utc":1748031487,"score":0,"text_length":5392,"vader_compound":0.993,"course_code":"C182"}

I saw a few but hope mine might help a little more. \n\nTLDR: used Tony bells 10 hour videos one for financial and one for managerial at 1.5x speed (13hrs total) and passed in 1 week. \n\nTo start off with I took 1 week exactly on this class. I took the Pre assessment first on a Sunday, and was lacking in 3 areas with basically no finance knowledge beyond personal. I did take the excel class first, so that portion was easy and fresh. If it\u2019s not for you, watch excelisfun on YouTube. That\u2019s how I passed the excel class fast. \n\nNow a lot of people recommend Edspiras playlists on the subject, But when I was looking at them they have a combined total of around 40 hours of video (at 1.5 times speed I believe) and the videos get way more in depth than the class towards the mid way point. Problem is you\u2019d have to try to line them up with the class units to shorten it, or be willing to take more time. \n\nI found 2 videos one on managerial, and the other financial, accounting by Tony bell both add up to only 13 hours at 1.5 times speed. Now there\u2019s times where he does countless problems you could skip, and some topics covered you can skip like how to write financial statements but just try to line up his videos with the course units. \n\nI learn best with lectures (videos) and not taking so that\u2019s what I did. Monday - Thursday I watched the videos, and Friday \/ Saturday I took all the unit tests, and pre assessment for review. Then OA Saturday night and I passed. \n\nI hope this helps someone.

{"post_id":"1kpvzdx","subreddit":"WGU","title":"D174 Marketing Management Study Strategy","selftext":"First of all, this class had wayyyy too much information. The course material, textbook, and videos were overloaded and over-explained compared to what was on the final assessment. This took me over 6 weeks to complete. After viewing the course material and most of the videos, I took the Pre-Assessment twice and failed. Then I changed my studying strategy, and I wish I had done this in the beginning. If I had to do the course again, this is what I would do. \n\n**Take the Pre-Assessment**. While taking it, take notes (I just made a bullet list) of every question asked and the terminology or concepts it is referring to. The assessment does a good job of going over the main concepts in every module.\n\nEX: If the question is \"A marketing manager for a corporation is working with decision-makers to determine the deliverables for a marketing research project. In which stage of the market research process is the marketing manager?\" I would list \"Market Research Process\".\n\n**Then watch the \"Get to the Point\" videos.** You can find this by going to \"Course Tips\" > and under \"Course Resources\" is \"D174 Marketing Management Course Resources.\" I believe they are called \"Get to the Point\" videos.\n\n**Take notes while you watch the videos.** Start with module 1. There are a lot of videos, but I would watch them all. This is the most time-consuming part. If a slide is talking about a concept you took note of, don't just write down what is on the screen. Listen to what they are saying about the concept and the examples given. This will be key when you review at the end. With that being said, I skipped a lot of slides with visuals or terminology that wasn't on the pre-assessment.\n\n**You may be able to test and pass at this point.** I wish I had tried my first attempt at the OA at this point. I probably would've passed. If you don't, pass... then I would go to the next step.\n\n**Review the course material unit tests.** In the course material, at the end of every unit (in the summary drop-down), there is a test available. If you need the extra studying, go through each unit test. The questions are way more in-depth than the assessment, so if you don't get a good score, you're fine (the highest I passed a unit was 80%). But it is a good review of the questions.\n\nThis course was too dense and wasted so much of my time. It's too much info for a 77-question objective assessment. I messaged my mentor when I failed the pre-assessment a second time, and he told me it was one of the top 4 or 5 hardest classes in my degree plan because of the load of info. But once I changed my strategy to get more direct info, the class wasn't as intimidating as the assessment.

{"post_id":"1kppp6e","subreddit":"WGU","title":"How I Passed D315 Network and Security - Foundations in 24 Hours","selftext":"First and foremost, I want to stress that this is not intended come off as me bragging, nor would I necessarily recommend you use the same method as I did. This is simply to document how I went through the course as someone looking to accelerate and I want to stress that if you actually want to absorb the information being taught, this is NOT the method for you. With that being said, here was my process for going through the course.\n\n5\/17\nI began the course at around 2 PM. Based off my own research from other very helpful Reddit posts, I completely skipped the course material and jumped straight into the D315 Version 2 - Recorded Instructor-led Lesson Videos which can be found under the Announcements tab. These are crucial, and I would say 99% of what you need to know for the OA will be covered in these videos. I watched all of the first 2 sections at 2x speed until I started getting mental fatigue from so much information that I decided to take a break. I am personally not a note taker which definitely helped speed up this process, so keep in mind if you like to take notes this may be longer. \n\nThese next steps were very important for me. After I watched all of the videos corresponding to one of the sections, I would first go to the Course Material and take the quizzes that can be found at the end of each section. I would do them to get an idea of what I understood and where I was lacking. After that, I emailed my CI to send me more practice quizzes for each section and I also did these after finishing each section\u2019s videos. Doing these really helped me build a picture for the OA. It\u2019s one thing to listen to the lectures but I think it\u2019s equally important to see how the material translates into test questions that you need to understand and be able to answer. \n\nAs I said I did this for 2 out of the 3 sections before going to bed for the night.\n\n5\/18\nI watched the videos for the final section and did the same practice quiz procedure as the first two. Once I did that, I went back and did every single one of the instructor-sent practice quizzes again to see how well I retained the information from a night of sleep. After scoring 90+ on each quiz, I felt confident enough to take the PA. For me, this was a bit of a shock as the questions were slightly different than the ones on the practice quizzes and even though I passed, it wasn\u2019t necessarily by flying colors. After this, I went back through the PA questions and made a few ANKI flashcards only on the information I knew I was still fuzzy on (for me, this was primarily OSI and TCP\/IP). After going through the flashcards for a bit and quickly scanning over the PA to make sure I understood most of what was being asked, I scheduled my OA. I will say this. The OA for me was VERY similar to the PA, to the point where some of the questions were identical. As a result, I breezed through it very confident and ended up with the score you see above. This was at around 1 pm.\n\nHere are some of my key takeaways:\n- Do not neglect the practice quizzes, they were my crutch\n\n- In the video lectures, the instructor will sometimes say something along the lines of \u201cIf you see questions asking about this on the PA, be sure to look out for these keywords: \u2026\u201d This concept in general was crucial. Instead of attempting to fully understand questions, I simply was looking for key words in certain questions which usually pointed to the right answer. \n\n- Have a good understanding of CIA and OSI. These questions made up a good chunk of my exam. Understanding CIA came pretty naturally for me but OSI was a bit of a doozy until I started breaking it down and making flashcards. For OSI, I used the pneumonic \u201cPlease Do Not Throw Sausage Pizza Away,\u201d to remember the order and this really helped organize the information in my brain.\n\n- Pay attention to the PA. In my opinion, if you can pass the PA then you have a really good chance of passing the OA. They were very similar in style of questions and difficulty for me. Make sure you go through and understand the questions you got right as well as the ones you got wrong. \n\nI\u2019m writing this right after passing the OA so the brain fuzz is still there which means I likely forgot stuff that I will make sure to add once I can remember.

This class is dense and kind of dry, so it\u2019s easy to forget things if you wait too long.\n\nIf I had to do it again from the beginning, I\u2019d:\n\n* Read the material\n* Take all the quizzes and unit tests\n* Focus hard on the practice assessment\n* Use the videos to reinforce the tough stuff And try to wrap all that up within 1\u20132 weeks so it stays fresh.\n\nHeads-up: The PA and OA are similar in content, but the OA questions are worded differently. I got a good number of WBS (Work Breakdown Structure) questions and a few math problems too, so brush up on those!\n\n**And finally\u2026 2 MORE CLASSES AND I\u2019M OFFICIALLY A WGU GRAD!! \ud83c\udf93\ud83d\udd25**\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/hql0p7mppg1f1.jpg?width=827&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=71cae2679fa6290af05a2fdebf12d937d9fbe990\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/7vpjoksqpg1f1.jpg?width=707&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=69d41da9a922a8904bc5ef3a2e279aa9408a95b4\n\n  \n","permalink":"\/r\/WGU\/comments\/1kpay4k\/c722_project_management_passed_tips_honest_review\/","created_utc":1747539932,"score":6,"text_length":1379,"vader_compound":0.9749,"course_code":"C722"}

I had a couple unsuccessful attempts at college 10+ years ago, with some AW\u2019s and F\u2019s on my transcripts due to some unfortunate personal circumstances and sheer irresponsibility. I ended up with only 9 credit hours and a cumulative GPA of 3.0.

I\u2019m ready to jump head first into more classes, but that\u2019s not gonna be in the cards for me. Yesterday I met with my WGU Academy Student Success Coach, and she informed me that I couldn\u2019t move my start date up to June 1 due to missing some deadlines for that start date. My question for you all is, is there anything productive I can do for the next three weeks (Coach stated they should open up orientation for me around June 15) to prepare for the rest of the first term Accounting classes? I\u2019ve already completed 24-25 and 25-26 FAFSA, done my MPN and loan counseling, requested prior transcripts and confirmed their delivery, and I\u2019d rather use this time to prepare than just sitting around until I can start orientation.

Same thing as Dion\u2019s exams)\n\nTotal Seminar CySA+ Practice Exams on LinkedIn Learning (Same as above)\n\nCompTIA CySA+ Study Guide (started it last week and only got to the end Chapter 6)\n\nAll of this took me pretty much 3 months because I work full time and I\u2019m somewhat of a procrastinator. I tried to study as much as I can while at work because once I\u2019m home, home life takes over and prior to today the last 5 months have been shitty.

I know that this is a newer course and I wanted to share my experience with this class to help those that will be doing it in the future.\n\nI was told by my mentor this can be a harder course for some students and through the course chatter, I saw a lot of frustration with the course.\n\n**My experience:** I had no programming experiencing other than taking 'intro to scripting and programming' course right before this course which uses the educational language 'Coral'. I really did not find this class to be that difficult. The OA imo was very easy overall and was very similar to PA. I spent about 1 month in the course.  I would make sure to take this class seriously instead of speed running it especially if needing it for additional courses\/certs in the future. I am in the BSNES Cisco Track, and this course is needed for the DevNet cert which is what I am doing now. Overall, I found other courses more frustrating and exams more challenging. Telecommunications course was miles more messy than this Zybook and Cisco CyberOps, CCNA, and CompTIA Cloud+ exams were way harder. I would definitely take all the noise on this course with a grain of salt. Good luck!\n\n**What I used:**\n\n* 'One Week Python' Udemy Course from Colt Steele (I tried to always be ahead in the Udemy course compared to Zybooks which helped a ton when Zybook labs would use things taught later in the course)\n* Zybooks (Udemy course does not go over modules (focus a lot on csv) or file handling)\n* ChatGPT (I would give ChatGPT a lab and ask for it to come up with something similar and then I would submit my code for it to 'grade'. I would ask for labs that practiced with iterables, arbitrary aguments, etc)\n* Quizlet (I used Quizlet to quiz on different modules\/functions that are available for each data type)\n\n","permalink":"\/r\/WGUIT\/comments\/1l5qro2\/d522_python_for_it_automation_experience\/","created_utc":1749318593,"score":4,"text_length":1856,"vader_compound":0.69,"course_code":"D522"}

Even my program mentor warned me this would be one of the least engaging courses in the program.\n\nI had no previous experience with databases (though I do have some programming background). So this was my first real exposure to data management. It took me about a month to finish, studying \\~5 days a week, 2\u20133 hours a day. I spent around a week of that just prepping for the OA.\n\nMotivating myself to study was\u2026 brutal. ZyBooks didn\u2019t work for me at all \u2014 the content is so dry it made me sleepy within 5 minutes. I quickly gave up on reading ZyBooks and instead used AI tools to rephrase the material into something more human-readable, with examples. That helped A LOT. I even had the AI turn those into digestible notes so I could review them more easily.\n\nAlso, these two playlists saved me \u2014 seriously, can\u2019t recommend them enough:\n\n1. [**Intro to Databases by Caleb Curry**](https:\/\/youtu.be\/h0j0QN2b57M?si=Ris1uj6yFXIALCpE)\u00a0\u2013 clear, entertaining, and beginner-friendly. I watched this at the very beginning and it helped me build a base-level understanding of how databases work. It doesn\u2019t cover everything on the OA, but still super helpful.\n\n2. [**Database course by Dr. Daniel Soper**](https:\/\/youtu.be\/4Z9KEBexzcM?si=duLNf_J9EyQ36260)\u00a0\u2013 this one\u2019s amazing. He covers almost every topic in the WGU course and explains them clearly. Perfect supplement to the official material.\n\nIn general, even though the WGU material was incredibly dry, I did find the topic of databases interesting. It was cool to finally learn how data works under the hood, especially since I had zero prior exposure to this world. I\u2019m glad I powered through it, but yeah\u2026 this one was a grind.","permalink":"\/r\/WGU_CompSci\/comments\/1kqj0k8\/passed_d426_data_management_foundations\/","created_utc":1747678928,"score":23,"text_length":1798,"vader_compound":0.9906,"course_code":"D426"}

I passed D196 on my first try and didn\u2019t find it too challenging but I do have some pointers for anyone willing to listen. \n\nTake your time and be patient. The OA is very different than the Pre-Assessment. I found that the OA tried to trip me up with the wording whereas the pre-assessment was fairly straightforward. I would recommend reading each question carefully so that you don\u2019t get tricked. For example, knowing the difference between direct and indirect costs, the difference between overhead costs, and the difference between costing methodologies will be important to know and distinguish between. \n\n  The test is heavy on units 6 & 7. I would recommend refreshing these modules before the test. I found that the excel portion was the same as the pre-assessment. They only had three or four CVP problems on the test which was surprising.. I thought there would be more. And they didn\u2019t put any cash flow questions on my test which I was also surprised about. The test seemed to be more focused on understand the concepts of the material more than the application of it. \n\nLastly, do not skip on learning the terminology. Study the meaning and the application of all the words associated with the course. They will ask you, in one way or another, what each word means. \n\nAll in all it wasn\u2019t a hard class like everyone says it was. Just a lot of information. Take your time and don\u2019t feel like you have to rush through the material to accelerate. Even though I\u2019m accelerating, I took my time on this class. Cheers.

I saw a few but hope mine might help a little more. \n\nTLDR: used Tony bells 10 hour videos one for financial and one for managerial at 1.5x speed (13hrs total) and passed in 1 week. \n\nTo start off with I took 1 week exactly on this class. I took the Pre assessment first on a Sunday, and was lacking in 3 areas with basically no finance knowledge beyond personal. I did take the excel class first, so that portion was easy and fresh. If it\u2019s not for you, watch excelisfun on YouTube. That\u2019s how I passed the excel class fast. \n\nNow a lot of people recommend Edspiras playlists on the subject, But when I was looking at them they have a combined total of around 40 hours of video (at 1.5 times speed I believe) and the videos get way more in depth than the class towards the mid way point. Problem is you\u2019d have to try to line them up with the class units to shorten it, or be willing to take more time. \n\nI found 2 videos one on managerial, and the other financial, accounting by Tony bell both add up to only 13 hours at 1.5 times speed. Now there\u2019s times where he does countless problems you could skip, and some topics covered you can skip like how to write financial statements but just try to line up his videos with the course units. \n\nI learn best with lectures (videos) and not taking so that\u2019s what I did. Monday - Thursday I watched the videos, and Friday \/ Saturday I took all the unit tests, and pre assessment for review. Then OA Saturday night and I passed. \n\nI hope this helps someone.

{"post_id":"1l15wr7","subreddit":"WGU_MBA","title":"Day 1 of my MBA (Healthcare Management) Journey - C200","selftext":"I'm a 47-year-old college kid who finished his undergrad at WGU this past April. Honestly, I never thought I\u2019d get that degree, so grad school wasn\u2019t even on my radar\u2014yet here I am.\n\nBack when I was working on my BS, it didn\u2019t even occur to me to check Reddit for advice or motivation until the very end during my capstone. That\u2019s when I stumbled across posts from actual college kids (like 18\u201322) who knocked out four years in just six months, some in just 90 days. Then I found this subreddit and saw people finishing their entire MBA in 2 months, 7 weeks\u2014even one person who claimed they did it in 10\u201320 days.\n\nAt that point, I thought, why not me?\n\nMy goal is to finish in one term, but if I can wrap it up faster, great\u2014I just get to my future sooner. I told my mentor earlier this week that I was ready to hit the ground running, and she opened up three courses for me.\n\nDay 1: I sat down at 10 AM, opened C200, and started writing. By the end of the day, I had submitted both required papers (with full APA citations) and completed the course. Now I\u2019m just waiting on grading.\n\n**Tips for anyone going through C200:**\n\n1. **Do the CliftonStrengths test when you\u2019re fully awake and caffeinated.** It\u2019s 200 timed questions with only 20 seconds each. I only timed out on one, but I needed the coffee first.\n2. **If you\u2019re into AI tools, there\u2019s a current student offer in the WGU MBA Facebook group for a free year of Google Gemini Pro.** I dropped my results into NotebookLM and had it generate a podcast-style summary about me. Honestly, it was the coolest AI thing I\u2019ve done so far\u2014and I use AI daily at work.\n3. **The rubric mentions using the WGU Library.** I never touched it during undergrad, but for this course, Section 2 of the textbook links directly to library articles on each leadership style. You can read them online or download the PDFs. I ended up pulling 5\u20136 sources from there alone.\n4. **Pro tip for citations:** When viewing a PDF in the WGU Library, there\u2019s a \u201cCitation\u201d button in the upper right. Click that, and it gives you everything you need for Word.\n\nI do have 20+ years of management experience, so I wasn\u2019t expecting much from this class, but it surprised me. Even though I only spent about 11 hours total, the second paper in particular gave me a valuable lens to look at my current leadership style and think about how to grow. That alone made it worth the time.\n\nIf you find little posts like this useful, let me know, and I'll be sure to post one after I finish each course. I work M-F, so I probably won't have another one of these until next weekend at the earliest, but you never know.\n\nUpdate 6\/2\/25: **I PASSED!!** I got a passing mark on one last night and just got the second one now. The grading team was really fast for this one!","permalink":"\/r\/WGU_MBA\/comments\/1l15wr7\/day_1_of_my_mba_healthcare_management_journey_c200\/","created_utc":1748828642,"score":42,"text_length":2841,"vader_compound":0.9851,"course_code":"C200"}

Python is brand new to me and I've focused a career in an unrelated field before coming back to finish a degree.\n\nLike many others, I thought I was struggling more with the zyBooks material and testing environment than I was learning the concepts of Python. The webinars \"The Gotchas\" from Jerry Spiller (especially the Exam Review video) and \"Tool Belt: Developing Skill\" from Mark Kinkead, and the \"Code-Arama\" cohort videos from Mark Kinkead were the most helpful tools for me to understand the zyBooks environment and the expectations to pass to pass the course.\n\nThe OA was very similar to the pre-assessment and practice exam 2. If you understand the concepts each of those questions are asking, solving the problems presented on the OA should not be too hard.\n\nTo learn Python itself, I did complete almost all of the zyBooks challenges, labs, and participation for chapters 1-14 and both practice tests. I did some of the additional labs, but focused on the questions in both practice tests. I felt like I was struggling understanding the material in the way it was presented by zyBooks. I read and completed the problems in Part 1 (chapters 1-11) of Python Crash Course by Eric Matthes and followed along with the Day 1-14 of 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp by Dr. Angela Yu on Udemy. Both of those resources were very helpful for me to understand what I was missing from the zyBooks material. Depending  on your learning style, you could probably pick the book or videos on Udemy and be fine. \n\nI have been enjoying learning Python through this course. I plan on finishing the 100 days of Python course videos. They're truly helpful projects for learning a language and retraining my brain to problem solve for programming. \n\nGood luck everyone.","permalink":"\/r\/wgu_devs\/comments\/1ks4dp9\/passed_d335_introduction_to_python\/","created_utc":1747850087,"score":33,"text_length":2072,"vader_compound":0.9586,"course_code":"D335"}

The first OA was pretty straightforward and aligned with the PA.\n\nFor the second section of the course, I did all the practice questions for units 5 (TVM) and 6 (Cash & Receivables), but I didn't do any of them for inventory.

I just decided to move on to the PA and come back to it if I was struggling.

I think I only caught a question or two that was functionally the same as the PA but with different values.

{"post_id":"1l44n7n","subreddit":"wguaccounting","title":"D196-Principles of Financial and Managerial Accounting-Help and Advice","selftext":"Hello All,\n\nI could really use your insight. I took D196 last term and unfortunately didn\u2019t pass the OA. I did reasonably well on the PA, so I thought I was on the right track. But once I got into the OA, especially toward the later part of the exam, I struggled a lot more than I expected.\n\n# Where I hit problems:\n\n1. **Calculation-Heavy Questions:** The last third of the OA was much more quantitative than I anticipated. I was okay with basic formulas like the accounting equation and even some basic CVP analysis, but once it got into multi-step break-even, contribution margin ratio questions, and variable\/fixed cost manipulation, I got overwhelmed. I think I froze on a few because I wasn\u2019t fast or confident enough with applying the formulas under pressure.\n2. **ABC (Activity-Based Costing) Confusion:** I thought I understood the concept of ABC, but the exam asked questions about overhead estimation and cost driver application that caught me off guard. I realized I couldn\u2019t clearly distinguish when to use ABC vs traditional costing, or how to identify the right cost drivers. Some questions used terminology I didn\u2019t fully recognize from the PA or cohort practice.\n3. **Confidence Erosion Mid-Exam:** As the questions got tougher, I second-guessed myself and ran out of time. I think I spent too long reviewing earlier questions and not enough pacing for the heavier ones at the end. Even questions I likely knew I started to doubt just because I\u2019d gotten rattled.\n\n**What I\u2019m hoping to get from you:**\n\n* Any tips for mastering the **calculation side** of break-even, CVP, or overhead rate questions (especially when they give you multiple variables).\n* How you prepared for and understood **ABC costing** in a way that stuck.\n* What you did to stay confident and pace yourself during the OA, especially when questions ramp up in difficulty.\n\nI\u2019m prepping for a retake and want to go in much more focused and intentional this time. Any experience, advice, or even just a sanity check would be hugely appreciated.","permalink":"\/r\/wguaccounting\/comments\/1l44n7n\/d196principles_of_financial_and_managerial\/","created_utc":1749143336,"score":3,"text_length":2110,"vader_compound":0.9567,"course_code":"D196"}

I had a couple unsuccessful attempts at college 10+ years ago, with some AW\u2019s and F\u2019s on my transcripts due to some unfortunate personal circumstances and sheer irresponsibility. I ended up with only 9 credit hours and a cumulative GPA of 3.0. None of those hours will transfer to WGU, which I\u2019m fine with, as starting with a clean slate seems to be the best option in my situation. At 31 years old, I\u2019m a completely different person than I was from 18-21, so I enrolled in WGU Academy and took D072 to increase my chances of acceptance. I passed that class with flying colors in 3 1\/2 days, studying a couple hours each night after I put my kids to bed. I\u2019m ready to jump head first into more classes, but that\u2019s not gonna be in the cards for me. Yesterday I met with my WGU Academy Student Success Coach, and she informed me that I couldn\u2019t move my start date up to June 1 due to missing some deadlines for that start date. My question for you all is, is there anything productive I can do for the next three weeks (Coach stated they should open up orientation for me around June 15) to prepare for the rest of the first term Accounting classes? I\u2019ve already completed 24-25 and 25-26 FAFSA, done my MPN and loan counseling, requested prior transcripts and confirmed their delivery, and I\u2019d rather use this time to prepare than just sitting around until I can start orientation. I will be cross posting in a couple other subreddits in order to receive as much good advice as possible. \n\n  \nYes, I made this account today, and yes, I'm a real person.

{"post_id":"1ks919z","subreddit":"wguaccounting","title":"D102 - Are you new to accounting? This might help","selftext":"Here is some advice from my experience in this class, hopefully it helps.\n\nFirst off, give yourself at least a week to get through all the material. I made the mistake of focusing too much on certain sections and skimming others, and of course, the OA had a ton of questions from the parts I didn\u2019t study enough. So try to cover everything evenly.\n\nOne thing I really can\u2019t emphasize enough: know your debits and credits. But more importantly, know how to apply them in journal entries, there were a lot of questions on that in both of my OAs. What helped me was using T-accounts and the (Debit)DEA\u2013LER(Credit) method:\n\nDEA = Dividends, Expenses, Assets \u2192 Debits increase\n\nLER = Liabilities, Equity, Revenue \u2192 Credits increase\n\nAlso, adjusting journal entries were a big deal, I had over 10 questions on that alone on both OA\u2019s.\n\nFor closing the books, you have 2 types of accounts: Nominal Accounts (Temporary) & Real Accounts (Permanent Accounts).\n\nYou ONLY close nominal or temporary accounts.\n\nThe way that helped me memorize and learn this was as follows: RED(DR) - ALE(CR)\n\nNOMINAL = RED (REVENUE, EXPENSES & DIVIDENDS) YOU CLOSE THIS ONES ONLY.\n\nREAL = ALE (ASSETS, LIABILITIES & OWNERS EQUITY) YOU DONT CLOSE THIS ONES\n\nMake sure you\u2019re solid on: Depreciation\/amortization rate calculations.\n\nHow to calculate the book value of assets (tangible and intangible)\n\nHelpful tip:\nLIFO = Sell new, keep old\n\nFIFO = Sell old, keep new\n\nAnd definitely understand the three financial statements:\n\nBalance Sheet = Assets, Liabilities, Owner\u2019s Equity\n\nIncome Statement = Revenues & Expenses\n\nCash Flow Statement = Cash coming in and going out\n\nKnow your formulas, you will need them:\n\nNet Income = Revenue - Expenses\n\nAssets = Liabilities + Owner\u2019s Equity\n\nNet Sales = Gross Sales - Discounts - Returns - Allowances\n\nRetained Earnings = Beginning + Net Income (or Loss) - Dividends\n\nCGS = Beginning Inventory + Purchases - Ending Inventory\n\nGross Profit = Sales - CGS\n\nEarnings Per Share = Net Income \u00f7 Common Shares\n\nAnd this is super important: take all the module and unit quizzes, some of those exact questions showed up on my OA. Also, do all the Excel exercises from the book and watch all the embedded videos. It\u2019s a lot, I won\u2019t lie, but if you do all of that, I can honestly say you\u2019ll be in a really good spot to pass, just like I did.\n\nYOU GOT THIS!","permalink":"\/r\/wguaccounting\/comments\/1ks919z\/d102_are_you_new_to_accounting_this_might_help\/","created_utc":1747861301,"score":116,"text_length":2396,"vader_compound":0.9942,"course_code":"D102"}

I just passed the OA for this class yesterday so I thought I would share my experience.  It mimics the PA completely in the types of questions and structure of the questions, but the answers vary slightly in the way they are worded. The PA is 45 questions and the OA was 51 questions.  Make sure you understand the % represented by 1 standard deviation, 2 standard deviations and 3 standard deviations, and how using the different standard deviations can affect the SPC. Make sure you also understand SPCs and what purpose they serve, as there are a lot of questions surrounding how to make use of SPCs, how to calculate the upper and lower limits, etc. You will need to know the difference between each SPC chart because there are questions that will ask you which chart would be best in this scenario. Also make sure you understand all of the vocabulary in the text, especially what muda, heijunka, jidoka and poka yoke mean. There are also a few questions centered around how services are designed, so it will be helpful to understand each step of that process and what it entails.  You don't need a calculator, but I had one handy just in case.  There are like 2-4 math questions, but it asks you about how changing one variable in an equation would affect the entire equation. The test will list any equations you need so don't worry about memorizing any. Also, you need to fundamentally understand the difference between six sigma and lean manufacturing, and what lean six sigma means also.\n\n  \nI personally read through all the material and took notes,  tool the PA and passed it the first time, but went back and re-studied every question I missed. I took the OA the next day with no issue at all. It took me about 1 actual week of work because I have been slacking. The OA could be tackled in 5 days or less depending on if you hit it hard with the note-taking.  It also helps if you have already taken D464 because there is a lot of overlap in the material covered in both classes.","permalink":"\/r\/WGU\/comments\/1li3smo\/d469_oa\/","created_utc":1750640832,"score":2,"text_length":2110,"vader_compound":0.9688,"course_code":"D464"}

I\u2019m growing increasingly upset as it looks like I\u2019ll be forced to waste money on another term. \n\n\n\n\n- I started my term Jan 1. \n\n\n- I transferred in 40 credits and had to complete 81 for the accounting program. \n\n\n- In march a few of the accounting program courses change. I am told I am not allowed to switch until a new term. Fine. \n\n\n- I was fairly confident I would finish in one term, informed my mentor of my plans to do so, but life comes up sometimes so I wasn\u2019t 100% this would be achieved. \n\n\n- So in march or April I arrive at certain courses in the accounting program that were set to be removed, so I ask my mentor if she can move them to the end, so if a situation arises that I don\u2019t finish the degree in one term, I can just change to the new program and do the new courses. \n\n\n\n- She says sure and removes them\n \n\n\n- Fast forward to the beginning of June and I have all of my courses finished except those two that she removed. I have plenty of time to finish them by the end of the term, C233 and D075. \n\n\n\n- I asked my mentor to open those courses and apparently they can\u2019t be opened. I started communicating with her to open the course in the first week of June. \n\n\n- It is now June 22 and the courses are still not open. She keeps being vague about the process of getting it open and something about the records department.\n\n\n\n- I contacted tier one support and they said since the courses were removed, they can\u2019t be added back for some reason. \n\n\n\n- When she removed the two courses in march she did not disclose that they would not be able to be added back even though she knew I intended to finish in one term and had made serious progress by that point. \n\n\n\n\n- Do they seriously expect me to pay for another term when I am not being allowed to work on my course work when I payed for a six month term??\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease if anyone has any advice I am dying for something, because I\u2019m getting no help from my mentor and I don\u2019t know who to call other than tier 1 support. I don\u2019t want to have to pay for another term. \n\n\nEdit: To reemphasize the how it went down, I asked her to move my courses so I can take them at the end. She curtly responds, \u2018no problem, done!\u2019 \n\nShe did not explain that the courses were actually removed or the effects of removing courses, as opposed to the simple rearrangement of courses that I thought was taking place. \n\n\nShe probably believed I wouldn\u2019t finish in one term even though she saw my progress and knew my goals.

(Tips)","selftext":"When I was researching what to expect for the D184 Objective Assessment, everything I found was honestly kind of terrifying. Most of the posts I came across were from people saying they were on their third attempt and still struggling to pass. The general consensus was that it was super difficult and nothing like the PA or any of the study guides.\n\nAfter taking it this morning, I can say I totally agree. While the content itself was familiar: things like identifying which type of assessment system was used, pros and cons of standards-based grading, etc., the wording was completely different. A lot of the questions had multiple answers that could be correct, so it felt more like picking the \u201cmost correct\u201d option rather than just the \u201cright\u201d one.\n\nWhat helped me most was taking the PA once, identifying my weak areas, and then retaking it until I scored exemplary across the board. I also drilled the Unit 1, 2, and 3 quizzes over and over until I basically had them memorized. I even retook the PA about 10 minutes before starting the OA.\n\nHonestly, that kind of brute force studying was the only thing that felt helpful. Even after completing the OA, I still feel like none of the course material matches the way the test is structured..and that\u2019s frustrating. It feels pretty unfair that we\u2019re being assessed with questions that are phrased so differently from the prep resources we\u2019re given.\n\nIf you're getting ready for the OA, just be prepared for it to feel familiar yet foreign. Drill everything you can and get comfortable with interpreting tricky wording.

I knew, since I was coming from an MLA background that this APA style was going to end me. I submitted my first performance task and it turned out I missed a part of the rubric. I wrote about clinical neuropsychology and didn't mention other doctors when talking about cultural competency. \n\nI fixed it and resubmitted. They sent it back (this was the only part of the rubric that was \"wrong\"). They said \"other doctors\" in italics... Which I had in the essay! I didn't want it to come back a third time, so before I submitted again, I scheduled a session with a course instructor. (Why isn't the course instructor and the evaluator the same person? That makes me crazy). Course instructor saw where the doctors were mentioned in the essay... She said \"maybe they didn't see it in the intro of the paragraph... Add the other doctors to the intro and see what they say\". \n\nI took it A STEP FURTHER. I had one example encompassing the doctors and families; this time, I created an example for the doctors alone and one for the families alone. There's no way they will miss it this time! \n\nI scheduled another session with the course instructor and she gave me her blessing to submit. She said \"if this doesn't go through then I don't know what they want\". I submitted... And it was returned... Again. \n\nI read the evaluator's comment and I was so confused. NOWHERE in any of the previous feedback did they say that I needed to have examples FROM THE SOURCES. Also, I left the evaluators a comment stating that the sources I used did not have examples but great info (so hard to find info for clinical Neuropsychology). So what I did in the essay was spin off examples from the information they provided. I used in-text citations and explained how the article supported the example. That was fine for every other paragraph (they all met competency on the first attempt) but somehow not for this paragraph. \n\nAlso, when they read my paragraph the first time, they complimented the example on the families.... Which... Wasn't cited from a source. They didn't say anything then about it needing to be from a source. \n\nBecause the assignment was sent back a third time, the assignment locked and speaking to an instructor was mandatory. I went with the first available instructor. I showed her how inconsistent the feedback was from the evaluator and how they were moving the goal post. They wanted something different every time and when I accomplished it, they gave me something completely different to do. The instructor asked what I wanted to do.... I said... APPEAL. \n\nThe paper went through the appeal process. The lead evaluator said that my submission should have passed and she had me resubmit it. They processed it this morning and I passed! Not just the assignment... But the course! \n\nIf you ever feel like something is off, do not hesitate to speak up! Approach the instructors humbly and provide your proof. It could make a world of difference! \n\nI hope this inspired someone to speak on something that may be nagging at them. If it doesn't feel right... Say something! \n\nOn to the next course!

It\u2019s one of the more approachable courses and helps ease you into WGU\u2019s system.\n\nYou can expect to spend 8 to 24 hours total to complete the course, depending on your writing speed and comfort with the material.\n\nWhat to Expect:\n\nThere are two performance assessments (PAs).\n\nEach is a 2\u20133 page paper on different ethics-related topics.\n\nYou don\u2019t need to read all the course material, but you should review the parts about ethical frameworks that are mentioned in the Task 1 PA. You\u2019ll be expected to apply one or more of these in your writing.\n\nBefore starting the papers, make sure you get the task guide (sometimes called the study guide). This is a SharePoint webpage created by the course team that gives detailed advice on how to complete both PAs.\n\nThe #1 tip from the task guide: cite the WGU course material after every paragraph, even if you\u2019re writing in your own words. This is key to passing on the first try. It might seem seem like a silly thing to have to do. But, at least you know to do it ahead of time. \n\nHow to get the task guide:\n\nIt's in the community tab I was told. But I just got in contact with the course instructor and she emailed the link right over. \n\nThe PAs: \n\nThe first PA asks you to choose a scenario that involves an ethical issue related to technology. You\u2019ll answer prompts based on the situation and apply one or more ethical frameworks. Follow the rubric and answer exactly what the prompts want. \n\nThe second PA is another 2\u20133 page paper, this time focused on ethics in a professional setting. You\u2019ll be given a website link that outlines different professional codes of ethics, which you\u2019ll reference and apply to your profession.\n\nFinal Thoughts:\n\nThis is a very manageable course if you take the time to use the task guide, cite your sources, and stay organized. Definitely one you can accelerate and complete quickly.","permalink":"\/r\/WGU\/comments\/1le9kdg\/d333_ethics_in_technology_my_ultimate_guide\/","created_utc":1750226153,"score":15,"text_length":2690,"vader_compound":0.9961,"course_code":"D333"}

I watched Tony Bell's Financial and Managerial accounting videos to prepare. They were almost no help lol. This class is more about the *basics* of accounting and not how to actually *DO* accounting. Prepare to do excel, I was *not,* so I looked like a grandma inputting the formulas. It was pretty easy once I went through the content. The course material videos are AMAZING, I felt like it laid pretty good foundations for an accountant or business major learning accounting.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n\\-I only watched the videos, I did not read any material. I did every single unit test and quiz.\n\n\\-I made flashcards for the terms I didn't understand, I'm sure there's a quizlet for this class, but I want them for my own personal use. To use in the future, since this is my career.\n\n\\-Reading reddit comments on this class made me think that I was gonna struggle on the OA, the tests in the modules where 10x harder than the OA. I was struggling on some module tests with the amount of long word problems in one section. There wasn't a single one of these questions on the OA.

{"post_id":"1ld5dqs","subreddit":"WGU","title":"D426 Data Management - Foundations Advice.","selftext":"Just passed this class, took the latest version version and it had a few syntax questions, these were very specific and really tested my knowledge on SQL. The questions were ambiguous in nature and a simple word could change the answer pretty much. Like for example it could ask \u201cpick where the x can\u2019t never be smaller than y\u201d and the options are like \u201c>\u201d or \u201c>=\u201c which i\u2019d say just take it for what it is and don\u2019t assume it could mean \u201cequal\u201d as well but that\u2019s just my advice. Other strong topic was indexes, like what would happen if you ____ an index type of questions. Sometimes i found myself reading the question over and over just to find clues of what it was asking for. I read about 40% of the zybooks, Watched Caleb Curry\u2019s videos, practiced syntax on W3 schools, watched the decomplexify\u2019s playlist on databases, studied the red text document and thought i would fail mid exam. Definitely know your keys, joins, normal forms, database design and cardinality. If you feel like you don\u2019t have a good grasp on being asked specific questions about these topics i wouldn\u2019t risk to take the OA. Took me about a month, it was a painful class for sure, but my main advice is to do the zybooks(including labs), practice your SQL because you\u2019ll be studying for 427 as well. This way i plan to finish the next class soon since i\u2019ve already did plenty of querying exercises. W3 schools is a great tool to go one by one testing every clause and then you can start mix and matching and creating your own queries. Don\u2019t be hard on yourself since this class is very dense. Found myself forgetting previous materials because i was too busy trying to grasp the next concept. Definitely the amount of material is what makes this class hard.\nAs a last note, if you\u2019re planning to finish this class quickly, i\u2019d say zybooks with it\u2019s exercises + red text document is the fastest way to tackle this class. If you\u2019re a visual learner do Dr Soper\u2019s SQL course + red text quizlet. \n\nDr. Soper\u2019s playlist : https:\/\/youtube.com\/playlist?list=PL1LIXLIF50uURxYXfBCaAXDzSdZlQiESy&si=0LWD9TXB1RlC0KVL\n\nQuizlets I used : \n\nhttps:\/\/quizlet.com\/839551998\/wgu-d426-objective-assessment-flash-cards\/?i=5x5tdp&x=1jqY\n\nhttps:\/\/quizlet.com\/1047946397\/d426-study-guide-red-text-only-flash-cards\/?i=5x5tdp&x=1jqY\n\n\n","permalink":"\/r\/WGU\/comments\/1ld5dqs\/d426_data_management_foundations_advice\/","created_utc":1750109513,"score":2,"text_length":2070,"vader_compound":0.98,"course_code":"D426"}

Here\u2019s how I completed it from first look to passing the test! \n\nWarning: Just because you know the terms does not mean you\u2019ll pass the test! They don\u2019t just ask \u201cWhat does ___ mean\u201d on each question! They ask, Johnny thought that all crunchy snacks were crackers. Johnny received a crunchy snack and read the bag and saw the name \u201cchips\u201d. According to ___ theory and accommodation, what will Johnny do with this information? Answer, because you should know what accommodation is: Johnny will note accept that not every crunchy snack is a cracker.\u201d \n\nBecause of this you have to read carefully and ACTUALLY UNDERSTAND what the definitions mean. But the instructors outdid themselves with the resources, so here\u2019s my EXACT process. \n\nTOOLS :\n1. Look in Course Tips and click the resources: There you will find: \n1. Link to the Instructors quiz let for each section\n2. Link to powerpoint practice tests\n3. Link to Unmuddy- D202 Study Guide\n\nI only used 3 things. I did not rest the book because I have ADHD and as we all know WGU has a unique way of drawing out information that could\u2019ve been 6 words into a 20 word run on sentence with a video link attached. \n\n\nStep 1: Read through the entire Un Muddy Guide. There is a read aloud feature on the sheet. You don\u2019t have to retain anything in this step, just pay attention to what you\u2019re hearing and read along to familiarize yourself. \n\nStep 2: Quizzlet. 1- 1.5 Hours per section (there are 3). I did the matching game for most of that time so I can recognize the answer in multiple choice. If you have  paid Quizlet then you can just do the tests but I don\u2019t. They do let you test once for free per section though so I suggest at the end of the hour do the test. After each session I got 97+% on the terms. I then combined them all and did one more round. \n\nStep 3: Took the pretest. This shocked me because of how the questions were asked but I still passed. I realized then I need to get more prepared for this type of questioning. Regardless my rule is if I pass then I set my test for 2 hours away and take the test. So I did that. \n\nStep 4: Found the 6 PowerPoints of questions. They are similar enough to the test although still vocabulary focused but now I\u2019m just training my brain to know how to answer the questions. I also went over my pretest coaching report and quizzed myself. \n\nStep 5: Test! I went from barely passing and getting almost competent on 2 sections to over competent and exemplary in multiple sections!\n\nThat\u2019s it! \ud83d\udc98\n\n\n\n","permalink":"\/r\/WGU\/comments\/1lcxguy\/d202_in_8_hours_my_timeline\/","created_utc":1750091459,"score":3,"text_length":2525,"vader_compound":0.9649,"course_code":"D202"}

{"post_id":"1lat91d","subreddit":"WGU","title":"D775 - Intro to Business Finance","selftext":"Making this post because there's very little advice online due to this being a new course. \n\n\u2022Firstly, do not get cocky. I passed upper level finance courses at a brick + mortar school in the past, but failed the first practice test for this course. Make sure you actually study\n\n\u2022 The OA I took today (June 2025) had a heavy focus on Section 1 material. This includes systems, markets, stocks\/bonds, etc. Make sure you have a solid grasp on all these topics. (No joke there were like 30 questions just about this section.)\n\n\u2022 Make sure you understand decision rules for NPV and IRR. \n-Positive NPV is good, negative bad\n- IRR higher than required rate of return is good, lower is bad.\nI had trouble fully grasping these concepts in theory but if you follow these decision rules, you'll be fine. Don't waste your time trying to understand the concepts if they're too difficult. Just use the decision rules.\n\n\u2022Understand the 5 ratio types. Be able to distinguish between liquidity, probability, etc. Most of the ratio questions\/answers were easy to deduce. Example: If the question was asking about profitability, the choices would be some combination of:\n a) Market ratio\nb) liquidity ratio\nc) Leverage ratio\nd) profitability ratio (correct)\n\n^Understand the general concepts and what they mean\n\n^^Oh also, all equations and ratios are provided for you in the exam for reference. I wish someone would have told me this before trying to remember them all.\n\nLastly, TVM is huge. This can be a tough concept to grasp, especially when you start dealing with annuities. I think if you can grasp the intro to this section, you should be fine. Most of these questions were general, like \"which of these numbers is PV? which is FV?\"\n\nThe OA was vastly easier for me than the practice assessment. I scored exemplary in all categories. Don't let anyone try to make you feel dumb - Finance is hard. Put in the study hours and you'll be fine. Just wanted to offer some perspective on the OA that I took, and what you should focus on.

I\u2019ve already passed both *CompTIA A+* exams, and I\u2019m planning to take the *LPI Linux Essentials* exam soon. My advisor also encouraged me to knock out *D100* *(Intro to Spreadsheets)* quickly before the term ends on July 31st.\n\nThat said, I\u2019ve been thinking more seriously about my long-term path. My old advisor (before he left) mentioned how networking is evolving fast, with more demand in cloud computing, automation, and security. I\u2019ve started to wonder if sticking with the networking degree is the best move, or if switching to something like Cloud computing, Information Technology (B.S.), or even Software Development would be a smarter, more marketable option for the job market. I also understand that it can depend on what I end up enjoying, and from the limited-hands on experience I have, with *TryHackMe*, setting up and trying to understand Linux and various distros, etc. , it's extremely intriguing, but I feel a bit lost.\n\nI don\u2019t have professional IT experience yet, but I\u2019ve been building a GitHub portfolio focused on Linux and simulated help desk tickets. I\u2019ve worked retail and customer service for the last five years, but I\u2019m now recently unemployed and ready to break into the field. Ideally, I\u2019d love to land a remote internship, even unpaid, if it helps me build experience and improve my resume. Remote would work best due to the competitive job market in LA County and limited transportation, though I could make it work in-person if necessary.\n\nIf you've gone through something similar, or have advice on which WGU degree paths are strongest for growth and landing that first role, I\u2019d really appreciate it. Also, any advice on how you landed a remote internship (or where to look) would be huge.\n\nThanks in advance!\n\n\n\n**TL;DR:**\n\nWGU junior in Network Eng. & Security with CompTIA A+ (soon LPI Linux Essentials).

Maybe it will for the CCSP whenever I take it.\n\n  \nBiggest help for me is previous knowledge of previous classes (sec+, Project +). Then doing the practice tests for each chapter (only 20 questions for each lesson). I only had a few questions on \"who is responsible in IaaS, PaaS\". Only maybe 3 questions regarding actual laws like SOX, etc. Of course each test might be different. What I'm getting at is, focus on the chapter practice tests, and then supplement with reading the chapters you got lower scores on. I got the average to about 17 out of 20 correct and called it a day. \n\nI didn't have any questions regarding OWASP top 10 either. \n\nSome of the questions are just so poorly written, for instance both are correct, but which is \"more correct\" I think is so dumb.

But don\u2019t rush through it either, or it could come back to bite you.\n\nWithin two days of starting, I passed the pre-assessment and \u2014 feeling confident \u2014 jumped straight into the OA. Long story short: I failed not by much\u2026. Not because the material was hard, but because I didn\u2019t take the time to ensure I actually had a solid grasp of everything I needed.\n\nHere\u2019s the catch: if you fail the OA, you\u2019re required to complete pretty much all the course content, especially the participation activities. They aren\u2019t hard, but they are incredibly tedious and not representative of the actual exam. In my opinion, they\u2019re a waste of time if you\u2019ve already studied \u2014 but they\u2019re mandatory once you fail.\n\nThat\u2019s the real reason I\u2019m posting this: to save someone else the headache. Even if you feel ready, make absolutely sure you are before taking the OA. Because if you fail, you\u2019ll be stuck doing hours of mind-numbing activities that don\u2019t really help \u2014 and the instructors won\u2019t make exceptions and don\u2019t care to help, no matter how ready you are. This is my last class of the semester and if I failed previous courses, the instructors were pretty lenient as long as I proved I had a grasp by the concept, but these instructors don\u2019t care about you or or your time.\n\nTL;DR \u2013 Don\u2019t rush. Prep smart. Pass on the first try. Avoid the busywork.\n\nEdit: Before anyone says anything I take full responsibility for my mistake and acknowledge this\u2026 realistically you can complete all the participation activities in a few hours, but what\u2019s the point if you\u2019re not actually learning. In my opinion, you might as well get something from them if you\u2019re having to do them anyways.","permalink":"\/r\/WGUCyberSecurity\/comments\/1le28jx\/heads_up_for_anyone_taking_this_class_d278_learn\/","created_utc":1750202927,"score":17,"text_length":1802,"vader_compound":0.9701,"course_code":"D278"}

I came into the program out of boredom and wanted to give the master's program a try. I had the following certs coming in: CISM, SecX, CySA+, and Pentest+, so that knocked out 5 classes.\n\nI immediately took the PA and OA for D487 Secure Software Design on the first day, and to my surprise, I passed.

They evaluated the papers, and they came back with a pass. They were easy for me to write quickly cause I've done pretty much everything the tasks asked for in my professional role.\n\nI am a big fan of the program since I do feel like this program shows what cybersecurity can be like in the real world and  I really didn't think the program was that difficult, but nonetheless, it is a good program from a professional standpoint.\n\nWhat I fear is that since I did it so fast, I am wondering if they will question the program themselves and I accidently screwed other students.  Either that or give my work to academic authenticity and delay graduation LMAO.... just to have one last look just in case (not sure if that's allowed)-.-.

I took metwo times, first time I failed with a 622, second time I got it just barely with a 688. This test for me focused A LOT on troubleshooting, so you should be studying for how to fix detailed issues of either a network having connection problems, printers having issues, or hardware failing from Hard drives to Switches. \n\nDo not be discouraged if you fail the first time! Try and remember the questions you struggled with as some of the same questions popped up again on my second attempt. \n\nI studied using flash cards, and while they were helpful in some scenarios, I was focusing too much on the definition of a word rather than its practical details and technicalities, which is what made this final so hard for me. Good things to remember is RAID types, all details and forms of 802.11\/802.3, printer process, and the steps to troubleshooting. Always read the question carefully, it\u2019ll say whether you are supposed to take the \u201cnext\u201d step in troubleshooting, or the \u201cfirst\u201d. I noticed a lot of hard drives and RAM questions as well. I mainly used the study plan on CompTIA, and while it\u2019s not optimal, failing the first time gave me a study guide assignment that actually helped with all the information I overlooked in previous chapters.

{"post_id":"1lcwehf","subreddit":"WGU_Accelerators","title":"D202 in 8 Hours (Timeline)","selftext":"Hello! Here\u2019s how I completed it from first look to passing the test! \n\nWarning: Just because you know the terms does not mean you\u2019ll pass the test! They don\u2019t just ask \u201cWhat does ___ mean\u201d on each question! They ask, Johnny thought that all crunchy snacks were crackers. Johnny received a crunchy snack and read the bag and saw the name \u201cchips\u201d. According to ___ theory and accommodation, what will Johnny do with this information? Answer, because you should know what accommodation is: Johnny will note accept that not every crunchy snack is a cracker.\u201d \n\nBecause of this you have to read carefully and ACTUALLY UNDERSTAND what the definitions mean. But the instructors outdid themselves with the resources, so here\u2019s my EXACT process. \n\nTOOLS :\n1. Look in Course Tips and click the resources: There you will find: \n1. Link to the Instructors quiz let for each section\n2. Link to powerpoint practice tests\n3. Link to Unmuddy- D202 Study Guide\n\nI only used 3 things. I did not rest the book because I have ADHD and as we all know WGU has a unique way of drawing out information that could\u2019ve been 6 words into a 20 word run on sentence with a video link attached. \n\n\nStep 1: Read through the entire Un Muddy Guide. There is a read aloud feature on the sheet. You don\u2019t have to retain anything in this step, just pay attention to what you\u2019re hearing and read along to familiarize yourself. \n\nStep 2: Quizzlet. 1- 1.5 Hours per section (there are 3). I did the matching game for most of that time so I can recognize the answer in multiple choice. If you have  paid Quizlet then you can just do the tests but I don\u2019t. They do let you test once for free per section though so I suggest at the end of the hour do the test. After each session I got 97+% on the terms. I then combined them all and did one more round. \n\nStep 3: Took the pretest. This shocked me because of how the questions were asked but I still passed. I realized then I need to get more prepared for this type of questioning. Regardless my rule is if I pass then I set my test for 2 hours away and take the test. So I did that. \n\nStep 4: Found the 6 PowerPoints of questions. They are similar enough to the test although still vocabulary focused but now I\u2019m just training my brain to know how to answer the questions. I also went over my pretest coaching report and quizzed myself. \n\nStep 5: Test! I went from barely passing and getting almost competent on 2 sections to over competent in all fields. \n\nThat\u2019s it that\u2019s all! \n\nThings I regret: I took a caffeine pill at 12am. It\u2019s equal to a cup of coffee. I wish i took it around maybe 8 before because I finished studying at 2am, Test was done around 4:30 & I had to work at 10 am\u2026. Was up for an additional 2 hours trying to fall asleep and I still woke up with energy lol. So maybe I guess it\u2019s a good thing I\u2019m not tired yet? \n\n\n\n\n","permalink":"\/r\/WGU_Accelerators\/comments\/1lcwehf\/d202_in_8_hours_timeline\/","created_utc":1750089032,"score":2,"text_length":2864,"vader_compound":0.9797,"course_code":"D202"}

Barely - Discrete Math 1","selftext":"Since so many people have posted threads helping others that I have read, I decided to just post this and give back. The OA honestly surprised me. I felt quite ambushed on a lot of questions, thinking \"well that's not cool\". \n\n**Here is what I did (I kind of took my time of about 2 months on this one given life events)**\n\n1. Went through all the Zybook participation activities and skimmed the reading material. (I'm ADD, so I need to dive into activities first). \n\n2. I really dialed into the PA questions and made sure I understood them as best as I could.\n\n3. Then i did all the supplemental worksheets provided in course tips\/announcements. \n\n4. I colored all the questions in red that I struggled with on the PA and worksheets. Snipped the questions and pasted them to Chat GPT and had it generate repeated questions on the sections I struggled with until I felt decently comfortable. \n\n5. 48 hours before the test i pretty much just went into the zybooks again and exercises at the bottom on topics i felt weak on and crammed. \n\n**So I take the test....** \n\nBasically everything I thought would be easy ended up tripping me up a lot. The PA I think is still a good starting point to understanding what's on the exam but.... the questions on the OA are pretty much all advanced versions of what is on the PA. I DO NOT recommend just studying the PA and thinking you are ok. Also there are definitely questions that are not on the PA as well.\n\n1. I felt so dumb as it was one of the first things in the book but there was a tautology question.\n\n2. There was a floor\/ceiling question that I don't remember being on the PA or even frankly the worksheets. \n\n3. There was this really messed up minimum spanning tree question where you had to pick the least weighted path or something. \n\n**General strategy and feeling of the test**\n\n1. I used every last minute of the test and didn't feel like it was enough. You really have to utilize time management and have your white board and calculator ready to not waste time. \n\n2. Honestly I always felt weak on proofs because it takes me forever to look at them to reach a conclusion. I kind of just judged if it was direct, cases, contradict, or contrapositive and if I didn't immediately understand the validity part i just guessed for a 50% shot. \n\nI guess I don't have many more points here. Just really recognize quickly if a question is worth your time, bookmark, and move on. I am very surprised relations\/graphs carried my score and that I missed so many boolean questions. \n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/q3t88b50gb8f1.png?width=833&format=png&auto=webp&s=7b65af475452aba3be4ad0534d30ee64d12ef365\n\n  \n","permalink":"\/r\/WGU_CompSci\/comments\/1lh2k4p\/passed_c959_barely_discrete_math_1\/","created_utc":1750528488,"score":17,"text_length":2558,"vader_compound":0.8599,"course_code":"C959"}
{"post_id":"1lgcssk","subreddit":"WGU_CompSci","title":"Got 100% on D427 - Data Management - Applications OA.","selftext":"[Coaching Report](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/5yceYOL)\n\nI took the OA a couple days ago and got 100%. I tried to post this as a comment on this thread: [https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/WGU\/comments\/1csds0w\/data\\_management\\_applications\\_d427\\_dans\\_guide\/](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/WGU\/comments\/1csds0w\/data_management_applications_d427_dans_guide\/) which seems to be the most popular thread on the subject, but I kept getting a \"unable to post comment\" error.  My guess is the comment was too long so I decided to make my own post.  \n  \nI wanted add my take because it looks like recently there was a revision to the course and tests, so a lot of the information about the old versions is out of date. Let me preface this by saying I have some hobby experience with SQL, so I picked things up pretty quickly\u2014but I did read the whole zyBook. I\u2019m not great at memorizing facts; I need context, so reading the whole thing worked best for me. I skimmed or skipped a few sections, but mostly read it all and did\u00a0*every*\u00a0lab until I could finish them without help. I spent about 4 days reading (spread out over 2 weeks). After that, I pasted the Table of Contents into ChatGPT and had it quiz me with 40 questions\u2014one at a time\u2014based on the TOC. The answers were all SQL, so I\u2019d write my response, paste it in, and it would tell me if I was right. If not, I\u2019d ask for hints until I figured it out.\n\nIn order to facilitate this, I downloaded the \"sakila\" database from MySQL (the same movie database used in the zyBook): [https:\/\/dev.mysql.com\/doc\/index-other.html](https:\/\/dev.mysql.com\/doc\/index-other.html)\n\nI used Sequel Ace (macOS) to interact with the database (search Sequel Ace in the App Store). For Windows you can use MySQL Workbench: [https:\/\/www.mysql.com\/products\/workbench\/](https:\/\/www.mysql.com\/products\/workbench\/)\n\nOnce I had everything up and running, I asked ChatGPT to quiz me using the Sakila database (it's a well-known database used for learning SQL). I think this helped a lot\u2014but honestly, it probably over-prepared me. I spent about two days working through the questions, and ChatGPT threw some pretty tough subqueries at me. The topics were in the book, but nothing in the PA or OA came close to that level of complexity. Take that for what it\u2019s worth. Personally, I\u2019m glad I did it\u2014I enjoy SQL. But others might see it as overkill.\n\nAs for the PA and OA, they were basically identical in terms of topics and question types (not word-for-word, but same intent). Both included a reference sheet, which definitely helped me get 100%. There were a few clauses I couldn\u2019t remember exactly, and the sheet saved me. I also noticed there were fewer than 10 multiple choice questions\u2014the rest were code lab-style questions, just like in zyBooks.\n\nSome people have mentioned having 4 hours for the test, but I only had 3 hours for both PA and OA, with 25 questions. I finished in about an hour. Honestly, with how the lab-style questions are set up, I think it\u2019d be hard to fail\u2014unless you go in not knowing anything. But that would show in your PA score too. If you do fine on the PA, you\u2019ll do fine on the OA.\n\nThe test format is identical to the zyBooks labs: you write your code, run it, see the output, then click \u201cRun Tests\u201d (basically the same as \u201cSubmit for Grading\u201d in the course material). The button on the test, though, actually goes a step further and checks not just your output, but also the format of your code. It might seem picky, but it basically tells you whether you\u2019re right or wrong. It clears up a lot of the old confusion about why an answer was marked wrong\u2014turns out it just wasn\u2019t in the format the grader expected.\n\nOne example that tripped me up on both PA and OA involved a join. There are multiple ways to write a join that give the same output, but if your syntax isn\u2019t exactly what it\u2019s looking for, you\u2019ll get a message like:\u00a0*\u201cFAIL: Check your query syntax.\u201d*\u00a0That\u2019s a huge clue. Without giving away the actual question, I\u2019ll just say the labs expect\u00a0**explicit column qualification** when doing **JOINS**\u2014meaning you need to include the table name with the column name in your SELECT (and other) clauses.\u00a0For example:\n\nSELECT\u00a0[Customer.Name](http:\/\/customer.name\/), Country.Code  \nFROM Customer  \nLEFT JOIN Country ON Country.CountryID = Customer.CountryID;\n\nNOTE: I just made up this example, it is not reflective of what's on test.\n\nNotice in this example that the Name and Code columns have their table names explicitly mentioned, even though they technically don't need to be (in the SELECT clause). I did try using alias names for the tables at first, but it failed the test, so I used the actual table names instead. Also, if the lab expects a LEFT JOIN and you use a RIGHT JOIN or vice versa, you will get the same \"query syntax\" error. And if you get the table.column format correct, and use the correct join, but you mix up the order of the tables (FROM Country LEFT JOIN ON Customer, for example), it will tell you the expected output is incorrect. So this tells you the syntax is correct, but the output is wrong and you need to fix something (in this case, the order of the tables).\n\nMy point being, using the \"Run Tests\" button is what makes the test almost impossible to fail... unless you truly don't know the material. It will save you from typos or mistakes in your logic. Let me know if anyone has any questions, and good luck!\n\n\u00a0","permalink":"\/r\/WGU_CompSci\/comments\/1lgcssk\/got_100_on_d427_data_management_applications_oa\/","created_utc":1750447761,"score":21,"text_length":4966,"vader_compound":0.9957,"course_code":"D427"}

Also memory hierarchy is going be asked so ensure you know that (The CI can provide a very helpful diagram).  In the study material specifically in Prof. Jack Lusby and Prof. Jim Ashe's webinars, they put a heavy emphasis on computational problems (which are good things to know how to do), but in both of my attempts there were maybe no more than 5 computational problems. There were at least two questions (on both attempts) that asked me about binary. Whether that be adding two binary numbers or asking how a number is represented in binary. Honestly the Binary questions are pretty easy so I would make sure to know how to convert a number into binary. So on both attempts I noticed that there was exactly one question about Verilog. This is something I do not remember being in the material, but if you do know what it is that one is a freebie. Questions 60-68 are pretty easy as well.

Everything else was new to me.\n2. Make sure you know the roles and responsibilities of gen ed teachers and special ed teachers for IDEA, 504, and title 3\n3. The PA is similar to the OA but the answer choices on the PA are a lot easier to eliminate the wrong answers. The OA, not so much. There were 2-3 questions on the OA that were on the PA.\n4. The gifted answer options are very confusing. There are maybe 4-5 questions on this and it was very easy to eliminate 2 of the answers while the other 2 it was hard to choose which was correct. And I have no idea if I selected the correct ones lol\n5. Be sure to know krashens theory and stages\n6. I highly recommend completing the study guides that are in the course if this is new to you. Even if it\u2019s not all it\u2019s going to do is further ingrain this info so you pass the first time around.\n7. Use the process of elimination on the answers. A good bit of the questions make it pretty easy to eliminate the incorrect answers. But several questions I struggled with which answer they wanted me to select. \n8. Make sure you know IEP\/504\/IDEA\/Title 3 very well. Heavy on title 3 but just be sure to know them all.\n9.

Because it's a transfer, I don't get the CompTIA Project+ exam voucher. My mentor laid out two options:\n\n* Option A: Ask admissions to reverse the credit. I would then take D324 at WGU to get the included exam voucher.\n* Option B: Keep the transfer credit and pay for the Project+ exam out-of-pocket (looks like it's over $300).\n\nMy mentor warned me that D324 can be a tough class and that having it cleared is a \"blessing\".

This post is for the folks who somehow have found themselves taking DM2, but are terrible at math because, well, it's scary and you nearly flunked algebra in high school but now you want a degree and for some reason you chose a math intensive one LOL.**\n\n\n\n**THIS IS HOW YOU BEAT THIS CLASS WITHOUT OVERCOMPLICATING IT WHILE ALSO BEING BAD AT MATH**\n\n  \nSo this class took me about 2.5 months. That said, 2 months of that was me putting off studying, being intimidated, and generally trying to AVOID THIS CRAP AT ALL COSTS. The emotional roller coaster this class sent me on is unlike anything else I've ever experienced. At the end I grinded my strategy below for about a week and passed with a B. Never met with a course instructor.\n\n\n\nFirst and foremost: USE YOUR CALCULATOR TO IT'S FULLEST POTENTIAL. Seriously though, you can learn to use your calculator to solve about 20% of the questions. Be smart about it. There are plenty of ways to use your calculator in strategic ways to solve some of this.\n\n\n\nSecond: The Zybooks are terrible. Open them once every 10 days to keep from getting kicked out of the class, but other than that, they're worthless. \n\n\n\n3rd: Get a subscription to CHATGPT. This is your new tutor. \n\n  \n  \nThis is literally all you have to do: \n\n* Go to the bottom of the main page for the class\n* Click on the [Supplemental Resources](https:\/\/westerngovernorsuniversity.sharepoint.com\/sites\/GenEdMathDomain\/calcdiscrete\/Shared%20Documents\/Forms\/AllItems.aspx?id=%2Fsites%2FGenEdMathDomain%2Fcalcdiscrete%2FShared%20Documents%2FStudent%20Facing%20Documents%2FC960%20Supplemental%20Resources&viewid=3990996e%2D29ee%2D427d%2Dbc49%2Da3d9e02d6577)\n* Find the [C960 Unit Review Forms](https:\/\/westerngovernorsuniversity.sharepoint.com\/sites\/GenEdMathDomain\/calcdiscrete\/Shared%20Documents\/Forms\/AllItems.aspx?id=%2Fsites%2FGenEdMathDomain%2Fcalcdiscrete%2FShared%20Documents%2FStudent%20Facing%20Documents%2FC960%20Supplemental%20Resources&viewid=3990996e%2D29ee%2D427d%2Dbc49%2Da3d9e02d6577)\n* Screenshot each question in each section\n* Open ChatGPT using the model o4-mini-high (The model that worked best for me doing this type of math. 4o would hallucinate and lose the plot, o3 and o4-mini would take too long to do things and get too \"by the books\" and overcomplicate things)\n* Paste it into ChatGPT and tell it NOT to answer the question, but to use it as a baseline to give you 3 sample questions\n* Answer those questions\n* If you don't know how to solve something, ask the agent to walk you through solving it BUT \"don't overcomplicate it, I'm bad at formulas, I'm bad at math. I have a whiteboard and a TI84+ and couldn't remember a formula to save my life. Just teach me how to work through it in the simplest way possible\" Then give you 3 more sample questions. \n\nThat's literally it. It's that easy. Just keep grinding out sample questions until you can solve them. \n\nThe big problem with this class is the material, every resource guide, every video, EVERY PIECE OF INFORMATION is riddled with trash language drawn up by some nerd. \"The binomial coefficient of the factorial frequency of \"x|n\u00ac\u03a3\u03a6| divided by 2x3 nPrC\" is the probability of a coconut falling on your head, but if AND ONLY IF the coconut is identical to the rest of the coconuts, because if they're individuals then you need to BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH.\"  \n  \nThis strategy will teach you how to do this without all that garbage. It's gonna say \"oh the problem looks like this\" to get the answer use \"12 nCr 3\" on the calculator. Maybe one or two other steps. This is how you take this class and make it easy to understand. \n\nBONUS, YOU STILL LEARN HOW TO DO THE THING, IT'S JUST NOT OVERCOMPLICATED FOR ABSOLUTELY NO REASON!\n\nThank you for coming to my TED TALK\n\n  \nNOTE: Below is my ChatGPT prompt. Yea, I know, it's probably garbage and could be way better. I'm no prompt engineer. DON'T JUDGE ME IT WORKED **LOL** \n\n  \n\"Hello, you're going to help me practice for a math test. I'm going to upload a screenshot with a multiple choice discrete math 2 question. You will examine the question, and give me 3 similar questions using different wording and numbers. Keep in mind, the sample questions will all be multiple choice. There must always be exactly one correct answer, and the answer choices should be mixed up (this means all of the questions can't be the same answer choice ie: all of them are choice A or whatever). I'll answer the questions, and then you will tell me if I was correct or not. After that we will move on. Keep in mind, there are some that I won't do well on. When I ask for you to walk me through a question (which will happen) remember that I DO NOT LIKE FORMULAS OR MAKING THIS COMPLICATED AT ALL. I want to simply be able to work through the problems as simply as possible with the tools that I have available. The tools I have are a white board and a TI84. I'm just trying to work through these, that's all. In the simplest shortcut way possible. If you understand the prompt and will follow the instructions as I've given them, please respond with LET'S DO IT.\"","permalink":"\/r\/WGU_CompSci\/comments\/1lint0z\/c960_discrete_math_ii_passed_2025_writeup_how_to\/","created_utc":1750702046,"score":88,"text_length":4694,"vader_compound":-0.9894,"course_code":"C960"}

I failed the first time I took the OA by one or two questions, and when I took it the second time I realized how little I actually knew\/understood during the first OA.\n\nIf I could go back I would study like this:\n\n1. Make notecards on the red text document and memorize them all.  \n2. Take the pre-assessment, review every question, and for every question you got wrong, write down the explanation for the correct answer.   \n3. A lot of people were saying they didn't finish the Zybooks, but it definitely helped with my understanding of the concepts. If you fail the OA the first time you take it, you have to finish everything in Zybooks anyway.   \n4. The joins definitely tripped me up, so watch some YouTube videos to get a solid understanding of how they work.

Pay attention to the syntax in Zybooks or whatever other source you use, just so you're familiar with how its supposed to look and you can select the right answers quickly.\n\nI'll be honest, the first OA seemed a lot harder and one could argue that is possibly because I didn't understand the material like I thought did.

{"post_id":"1lky26z","subreddit":"WGUCyberSecurity","title":"D487 - PASSED, here are some tips","selftext":"Hey All,\n\nThis one can be a bit tricky...\n\nI struggled with this course initially after going through the material the first time lot of it didn't make sense and found it really difficult to digest.\n\nSo after failing my first attempt I realized that trying to read a chapter then watch a video was really confusing to me. I personally find it difficult understand the information like that so I decided to ignore the PC for a while and picked up a physical copy of the Book (Don't do that) It took me about 3 days to read all 9 chapters and after pretty much ignoring all other course material everything became clear.\n\nSo my first tip if you're having difficulties is to first read the book while completely ignoring the videos (Accel TIP - You DON'T NEED THE VIDEOS TO PASS THIS, THE BOOK IS ENOUGH). Once that's done you can take a day to watch the videos esp for lesson 3 which didn't have a reading assigned to it.\n\nFrom the course resources. the SDL templates 1 and 2 is the perfect study notes to gather all the SDL\/SDLC activities, deliverables and goals into one place - you can find a vast majority of it at the end of chapter 9 to fill out.\n\nThe SDLC can be confusing to remember at first. FOR ME the easiest variant to remember is the one from the book that starts begins with concept which maps to the SDL. I actually printed out that page and wrote the 8 phase version on top so I could study both.\n\nWhen you get to threats\/ risk mitigations and countermeasures memory tip - STRIDE = risk identification, DREAD = risk ranking\/prioritization, \u00a0PASTA = complete risk analysis with 7 stages.\n\nPay attention to the Web Application Security Frame section KNOW THOSE COUNTER-MEASURES, Also know the section on RISK Mitigation\n\nLast thing, be sure to know the SDL activities mapped to the SDLC activities by heart and keep the CIA triad in mind. The reason being that when everything else doesn't make sense you'll more or less be able to see through the confusion. The questions usually point you in the right direction for eg. What is X at Y phase and that's usually the key as to where you need to look once you know the phases and the mapping to the SDLC regardless of how nice an answer may look if it's not matching the phase they are asking about it's not the correct answer, that got me a lot of times on the first attempt don't fall for it.\n\nOne last thing --- THE PA AND OA ARE SIMILAR, I wouldn't even say that the OA is harder it's just slightly different questions. HOW TO USE PA to gauge the OA -- DO NOT LOOK AT THE ANSWERS TO THE PA WHEN YOU TAKE IT THE FIRST TIME -- go back study the material ideally  you should be able to pass by studying chapters 2-7, then the BSIMM and OPENSAMM from chap 9, you can actually do it with less but if you read those chapters once then use the notes below you should be fine.\n\n\\-NOW  AFTER STUDYING IF YOU'RE NOT COMFORTABLY PASSING THE PA without looking at the answers don't waste your time with the OA, at minimum 95% chance of failure if you attempt it. BUT if you start COMFORTABLY passing the PA without having to review your answers then you should be able to pass the OA no problems.\n\nAlso take a look at John Mientel notes it's a 10 min read but really really good. link below:\n\n[https:\/\/github.com\/johnnymeintel\/d487-secure-software-design](https:\/\/github.com\/johnnymeintel\/d487-secure-software-design)\n\nHope this helps.

Read if you haven't taken it yet.","selftext":"I want to preface this by saying that I don't usually post on this subreddit or much at all but I've seen so many posts about how hard this class is so I wanted to say something about it. For a little background, I first tried an intro to accounting class at a brick and mortar maybe 5 years ago. Failed it horribly. Couldn't grasp anything. Now? I just passed with flying colors and got exemplary on 4 sections. This may have been one of the easiest OAs I've taken, and that's saying a lot because I've done 15 or so classes and it's my first semester.\n\nI think people get spooked by the concepts and give that more weight than the actual material. I was super nervous about this class so it's the only one where I actually sat and read through everything page by page. I read each word, took notes, and did the unit and module quizzes. That's it. I didn't even reread the notes. Writing things down helps a lot with retention.\n\nI did this while being a SAHM and caring for my toddler around the clock. I've been waking up at 4 am to study and reading throughout the day. I feel pretty silly now because I could have done this at my brick and mortar but I was afraid of accounting as a concept, even though it was my major at the time, lol. I'm now realizing how much of it is intuitive. And I really enjoyed this class.\n\nI say all this to say that all you need to do is sit down, read, and focus. If you do that, the PA and OA will be a piece of cake. Nothing was hard at all. I didn't even intend to accelerate with this class.\n\nThe material is repetitive and things get a bit tricky when it comes to managerial accounting, but that's about it. The Excel portion is very simple. You just need to know that horizontal analysis is basically (current sales-prior sales)\/prior sales and vertical analysis is line item\/sales. Besides that, know the difference between job costing, process costing, and activity-based costing. Know the CVP formula and how to manipulate it based on what the question is asking. Know cost centers, profit centers, and investment centers.\n\nTake your time when reading the questions. Some answers are nearly identical and it comes down to nuance. I took the PA maybe an hour before the OA and found them to be extremely simliar. Not a 1:1 match but I felt prepared for what was on the test. The module quizzes were harder than the OA. Aim for at least 80% on all the quizzes and you'll be fine. I got 100% on almost all of them. If I missed a question, I redid it without seeing which one was wrong and then deciphered what I'd misudnerstood.\n\nGood luck!\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/2o8ab5q9fl9f1.png?width=4428&format=png&auto=webp&s=2f75bc1840ee2f47af6cd3ab501ced10546c8fe0\n\n","permalink":"\/r\/WGU\/comments\/1lmdyha\/d196_completed_in_3_days_read_if_you_havent_taken\/","created_utc":1751084594,"score":2,"text_length":2652,"vader_compound":0.9844,"course_code":"D196"}

He clearly explains what\u2019s important for the OA versus what\u2019s just good to know for industry.\n\n\ud83d\udc0d **Python Experience (Optional but Helpful):**  \nI\u2019m familiar with Python, so those questions weren\u2019t too bad. If Python is new for you, follow the pacing guide and the beginner-friendly path in your version of the course\u2014it really helps.\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f **Heads-Up:**  \nEven though Professor Lusby said the OA focuses on sorting algorithms from zyBooks, I *did* get a question on **count sort**\u2014just a heads-up in case it pops up for you too!\n\n\ud83e\udde0 **Study Strategy That Worked for Me:**\n\n* Watched [Professor Lusby](https:\/\/wguconnect.wgu.edu\/hub\/wgu-connect\/groups\/c949-data-structures-and-algorithms-i\/resources\/post\/jack-lusbys-webinars) & [Dr. Youngblood](https:\/\/wguconnect.wgu.edu\/hub\/wgu-connect\/groups\/c949-data-structures-and-algorithms-i\/resources\/post\/recorded-cohorts) videos (both are gold)\n* Completed all **zyBooks participation & challenge activities**\u2014these drill the concepts well\n* Made my own **Quizlet** to memorize Big-O complexities of sorting algorithms (especially average & worst case)\n* Took the **Pre-Assessment (PA)**, exported the questions to PDF, then used **ChatGPT and NotebookLM** to quiz myself and clarify weak spots\n* Downloaded each **Zybooks chapter** and used ChatGPT + NotebookLM to build **teach-back scripts**, which I reviewed like I was the one teaching the lesson. Honestly, this helped solidify the material more than anything else.\n\n\ud83d\udca1 **Tip:**  \nThe core data structure ideas aren\u2019t that hard\u2014it just takes *practice*.

Any feedback\/insight on the following question would be greatly appreciated. I'm also open to videos as well. Unfortunately, the WGU video did not have this specific type of example.\n\n**It is January 1 of Year 2.** \n\nSales for Mac Company for January, February, and March are forecasted to be as follows:\n\n    January, 200,000\n    February 400,000\n    March, 500,000\n\n    80% of sales are credit sales.\n    The remaining 20% of sales are cash sales. \n    Of these credit sales, 10% are collected during the month of sale.\n    30% in the following month\n    60% in the second following month. \n\nTotal sales for November and December of Year 1 were 200,000 and 400,000, respectively.\n\n**What is the forecasted amount of total cash collections in March of Year 2?**\n\n=======================\n\nAlthough I've confirmed the correct answer is $332,000, I'm a bit confused as to why. This is my first official accounting course, so I'm up for the challenge of learning.\n\nThe way I had approached this question was as follows:\n\n    January:\n    \n    200,000 x 0.20 = 40,000 (cash sales for January) \n    200x0.80 = 160,000 (credit sales for January)\n    \n    However, only 10% of credit customers will pay:\n    160,000x0.10 = 16,000 \n\n    February:\n    \n    400,000 x 0.20 = 80,00 (cash sales for February) \n    400,000 x 0.80 = 320,000 (credit sales for February)\n    \n    However, only 30% of credit customers will pay: \n    320,000 x 0.30 = 96,000 \n\n    March:\n    \n    500,000 x 0.20 = 100,000 (cash sales for March)\n    500 x 0.80 = 400,000 (credit sales for March) \n    \n    However, only 60% of credit customers will pay:\n    400,000 x 0.60 = 240,000\n\n`Cash collections total = 220,000`\n\nI\u2019m receiving a total of 220,000 (added all cash sales), but this wasn't one of the options to select. I did ultimately check ChatGPT to find out where I went wrong (after attempting to resolve it on my side), and it appears that 60% of credit sales is actually intended for January, February 30% and March 10%. \n\nI'm unclear as to why 10% wouldn't apply in January, 30% in February, and 60% in March.

Before starting, I came on here and read how difficult the course was, and yup, this one got me. I read all the material, it was so much that I took many many & many notes. Took about 2 weeks to finish reading everything, as I also stopped many times to create flashcards, and also fill out the study guide & do the study guide quizzes. I also really only have night time free. At the end of the course, I knew I would not pass the test as it was just tooooo much info. I took the oa after a couple of reviewing days and did not pass, it truly tickles my brain how much information is in one section, and only about 10 to 14% will be on the test :\/ My first OA was actually similar to my PA and surprisingly I passed the PA, but idk what happened with the OA.

But I would say it may be difficult to understand the videos if you haven't read the material or at least know some of it. This course is definitely not the type where you can memorize the definitions of terms. You have to know and understand HOW the project life cycle process works, EVERY SINGLE STAGE.

{"post_id":"1ln1804","subreddit":"WGU","title":"D174 Marketing Management - My experience + tips","selftext":"Heya. I just finished D174 Marketing Management and wanted to do a write-up of my experience and give you some tips to help you get through this course. This is a very content-heavy course, but it does have a lot of valuable information you'll want to take the time to learn and understand. I do have prior marketing experience going into this class, but a lot of the terminology and concepts were new to me, so I didn't take it lightly.\n\nNote: I tend to be very thorough, so I'll include a TL;DR at the end for those of you who want the short and sweet version, lol.\n\n**How long did it take you**?  \nI put this course on hold a lot because IRL got hectic for me and I started struggling with my mental health, but I'd say it took me **2-3 weeks** to finish this course. I started by completing the study guide, as that was the advice I saw from several people on Reddit. It took me several days to finish it because this course is so content-heavy, and I kept getting bored copying and pasting the answers from the book.\n\n**What helped you learn the material**?  \nCompleting the learning checks, module quizzes, and unit tests in the course material was extremely helpful when learning the material and preparing for the OA. The flash cards (now located in WGU Connect) were also very helpful, albeit boring to go through.\n\nReviewing my entire PA pre-assessment report was helpful, too, as a few of the questions on the PA were on my OA. I reviewed all of the questions, even the ones I got correct, to ensure I knew the answer and why it was correct.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, I started by completing the study guide. While it did help me get familiar with the material, I ultimately didn\u2019t find it very effective. It was extremely long and content-heavy, which made it overwhelming and difficult to review. I often found myself lost in the sheer volume of information rather than actually retaining it. Maybe it's because I'm ADHD, but it was just too much for me and gave me content overload.\n\nSeveral people recommended the \"Get to the Point\" videos, so I gave them a try. They were not a big part of my preparation, though, because they didn't fit my learning style. These videos contain slide presentations with narration, and I kept getting bored and distracted while listening to them. I'm just not a huge fan of videos for educational content unless they're showing me how to do something. Still, I wanted to mention them, though, in case you like that type of content and find it helpful.\n\n**Did the PA align with the OA**?  \nPretty much. The difficulties of the PA and OA were very similar. Some of the questions from the PA were even on the OA. The only thing that was different between them was their length. The PA had 70 questions and, the OA had 79 questions.\n\n**How was your experience with the proctor**?  \nSome people have horror stories about their experiences with the proctoring system, so I sometimes get nervous about having to take an OA. However, I've had nothing but great experiences with them so far. It was easy to schedule my test, and they were kind and quick during the pre-check. I started my test right on time.\n\n**My Tips for You (and the TL;DR)**:  \n1. Do every learning check, quiz, and unit test in the course material  \n2. Go through the flash cards  \n3. Watch the Get to the Point videos (if slides + narration fits your learning style)  \n4. Review your entire pre-assessment report, even the answers you get correct  \n5. Don't take this course lightly if you have prior marketing experience\n\nGood luck! I'm happy to answer questions or give advice.","permalink":"\/r\/WGU\/comments\/1ln1804\/d174_marketing_management_my_experience_tips\/","created_utc":1751155698,"score":2,"text_length":3628,"vader_compound":0.9859,"course_code":"D174"}

Got roughly 75-80% based on the position of the bar.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nResources Used:\n\n75% Udemy supplemental videos\n\n25% Zybooks\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe Udemy videos were foundational to my knowledge. The links are provided right in the \"Learning\" course information section under Video resources. It gave me a good overall understanding of the material. I've seen the information a time or two over my academic career, but I definitely needed the refresher.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nGET A GRAPHING CALCULATOR!!\n\nI have the Ti-84 and it made a lot of the matrix math easier for me. It doesn't help with all of them though, and I think some of the questions are structured that way on purpose. To give a vague example, instead of asking you something you could just use the rref( function in the calculator for, it asks for what would a step in the middle of the process of manipulating the matrix would look like. Sorry trying to be vague here without giving too much info.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe graphing calculator also helps with series and limits problems as well. Just as when I described Calculus I, you have to know the material to properly setup for solving it. Not to mention a whiteboard I think is critical to work through the problems. It helped me visualize some of the questions so I could work through them and solve them.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe videos don't cover all of the necessary material, so I had to review Zybooks as well to round out my knowledge. There are some topics missed in the videos. I studied first to get an overall idea of the topics before taking the Pre-A. I got 75-80% on the Pre-A, so I scheduled and took the OA a few hours later and got the same score. The Pre-A is good to see where your knowledge is at, but you have to know more for the OA.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThis course is definitely material heavy, but not as much as Calculus I was. Be sure to allow yourself enough time to learn. I had this course open for a while, but It took me about 4-5 days of earnest study with 5-ish hours a day for me to feel like I knew enough to take the Pre-A and OA.

I passed the PA after 2 weeks of studying but wasn\u2019t feeling too confident, so I took an extra 3 days to study and actually learn what each term means, in my own words. I passed the OA with an exemplary result! This is what I did: \n\n1. Watch all the videos and fill out the study guide. It seems overwhelming but it really makes a difference. No need to read all the material. Just the study guide. \n\n2. After you fill out your study guide, upload it to Google NotebookLM. It will create a podcast with a summarization of the material. The 2-person podcast sounds very realistic and uses easy comprehensible language. This made a HUGE difference for me. I\u2019d play the podcast while driving and at home while cleaning or cooking. \n\nWhen you feel confident, go over a blank study guide and try to answer the questions out loud, using your own words. This will give you an idea of what you still need to focus on.\n\n The OA questions weren\u2019t too difficult. However, they can be very tricky. Make sure you understand what\u2019s asking you and use the process of elimination to determine the answer. Don\u2019t second-guess yourself too much. \n\nI shared my study in the WGU Connect group for this course. \n\nGood luck!","permalink":"\/r\/WGU\/comments\/1lpwdd8\/how_i_passed_d080_managing_global_business\/","created_utc":1751464211,"score":2,"text_length":1283,"vader_compound":0.9855,"course_code":"D080"}

It took me a few hours to complete but I submitted it on day one. My first submission was given a passing score\n\n**C716 SRM3 Task 1**\n\n* I read a lot about how to get passing grades on these assignments prior to the first day of classes and the recurring theme was to just follow the course tips document for each assigned task, do exactly what they say, and to check it against the rubric to make sure every part of the assignment was completed.

She encouraged me to just start writing, which I did.\n* Here is what I did pretty much step by step resulting in a passing score on the Task 1 assignment on the first submission attempt. A note: Do not overthink how to complete these assignments. There is no point in being extra because it will not get you a better grade; it\u2019s pass or fail. You have a much better chance of getting a passing score on every Performance Assessment with fewer attempts if you just follow what the class resource docs and video (combined with the rubric) tell you to do.

Open the Task 1 Tip Sheet doc -  *This is the document that will literally tell you every single item that\u2019s going to be required and the resources needed to get it right \u2013 so just do what it says. Seriously - Just read it in full and follow the instructions like it is a manual that if you deviate from you will be fired.*\n10. ***Just start writing***\n11. Reference the rubric from MyWGU the whole time you\u2019re writing. Imagine it is your bible and you will be damned for all eternity if you don\u2019t check every single box. If you don\u2019t, they\u2019re just going to return it and have you make corrections until the rubric requirements are satisfied.\n12. I personally needed help with APA formatting, so I used the APA template provided which worked well for me.\n13. If you need help with more detailed examples of how to do APA in-text citations and references I suggest just googling it. Helped me tremendously.\n14. Check it once you think you\u2019re done against the Tips doc and then against the rubric.\n15. Run it through Grammarly and make the necessary corrections.\n16. Check it again against the tips doc and then against the rubric. If you make any changes during this review be sure to run it through Grammarly again and follow the monotonous reminder of **CHECK IT AGAINST THE TIPS AND RUBRIC AGAIN.**\n17. Now you\u2019re ready to submit it. If you did what I said to do above there is like a 99% chance you\u2019ll get a passing grade on Task 1 first attempt.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* A last note of encouragement \u2013 the hardest part was getting started, so just get started. I ended up getting through the three tasks in two days. The second task was the easiest \u2013 you just create a cover page and a resume. Again \u2013 there\u2019s no need to be extra, just find templates and enter the basic information required. Task 2 was submitted and received a passing score first attempt. Task 3 was the hardest for me. In short, google the task name and watch other people\u2019s videos to wrap your head around what you\u2019re supposed to do after watching the task video. Do your best not to overthink it. I can\u2019t say at this point if my Task 3 submission will be given a passing as I just submitted it this morning after pulling an all-nighter to finish it before vacation. If they require me to make changes and submit again, I\u2019ll detail why when that time comes. When I get a passing score I\u2019ll write a detailed guide on how I did it because it was the time-consuming task for this class and it did not come easily for me to complete.","permalink":"\/r\/WGU_Business\/comments\/1lr0c8e\/c716_srm_3_task_1_passed_1_attempt\/","created_utc":1751575380,"score":2,"text_length":5292,"vader_compound":0.997,"course_code":"C716"}
{"post_id":"1lp6hhl","subreddit":"WGU_CompSci","title":"C949 - Passed in 14 Days","selftext":"Hey guys, just wanted to give anyone who needs it some confidence for passing DSA I. It is not that hard! If you have already taken Intro to Computer Science and Discrete Math I, you will have a much smoother time with DSA I. Our work with graphs in Discrete Math gives you plenty for the graph and trees questions on DSA I. Also the work on stack and queues from Intro to CS will help you for DSA I. Also if you have programming knowledge it will help with some python questions as well as class questions. The biggest chapters to focus on for DSA I are chapter 1 and 11. That will be the bulk. Also there is maybe 1-3 questions that actually are not in the book, but you can figure that out from taking the PA.\n\nWhat I did personally was I finished chapter 1 and took the PA. I got approaching competentence. I then went over my weak points which was just more specific ADT knowledge that can be found in the middle chapters. I then honed in on chapter 11 and never really went back to chapter 1. I then took the OA and got competent. So to say the least this class is very doable. Good luck to everyone and happy studying!\n\nAlso I forgot to mention I had the flu for 7 days so technically I would have passed in 1 week.","permalink":"\/r\/WGU_CompSci\/comments\/1lp6hhl\/c949_passed_in_14_days\/","created_utc":1751387945,"score":10,"text_length":1262,"vader_compound":0.9481,"course_code":"C949"}

I wanted to share my experiences while they are fresh on my mind.   \n**First**, this class is not as easy as some suggest. I work with Excel every day, but usually others have formatted the workbook for me. It was a challenge remembering different functions and operations in Excel.   \n**Second**, it is a tedious exam; be prepared to focus hard on the questions and make sure you are answering things correctly. I know that's \"common sense\" to some, but it is good to keep in mind.  \n**Third**, the test is very straightforward. It will tell you what it wants and where. So it is not that bad in that regard.\n\n  \n**Some tips**: I created a cheat sheet via ChatGPT that I will share at the end. However, here are some quick tips. You can use the search function on the Excel sheet with no repercussions. This is good to know in case you can't find the shortcut on the menu bar for a particular action. You can hover your mouse to understand what a function does. Some people are not aware of this. Finally, the PA is similar to the OA, if you found the PA easy, the OA will be even easier. \n\n**\ud83d\udcda 1.

{"post_id":"1lrz7l9","subreddit":"WGU_CompSci","title":"Calculus Passed! + Tips C958","selftext":"Background: Never took calc before, sucked at math, took WGU precalc and then c958. I have only done college level algebra and stats before as far as similar classes.\n\nTime to completion: 8 weeks. Took the PA at 7.5 weeks and got competent+ so took the OA and got competent. PA and OA were very similar, OA just slightly harder and had a few more questions.\n\nDifficulty: 3\/5- the tests are not as bad as the material but there are some fundamentals you really have to master and it takes lots of practice. I felt like I studied hard for this course and put in dozens of hours, but nothing was too bad. I think hardest for me personally is u subs and integration by parts, as well as the more difficult optimisation and related rates (cones and boxes with flaps etc) Time is a factor on the tests.\n\nPrep: I did about half of the Kahn Academy diff and Integral calc courses and used Zybooks at the same time to make sure I was doing the right kinds of problems. There are large chunks of each course that you don\u2019t need, and I used the exam rubric in the supplemental materials to help keep me on track. I watched Organic Chemistry tutor calc playlist here and there. I heavily used chat GPT to generate practice problems for me and practice quizzes. This was a huge benefit as there really aren\u2019t too many practice problems of each kind in the zybooks. I made a study guide on theory stuff which helped me remember how to approach problems and interpret graphs and stuff like that, really helped with the analytical type questions. The chapter reviews were great and harder than the test IMO, so worth doing as well. \n\nTools and advice: graphing calculator. Highly recommend getting super good with one as you can do a ton with it. Numerical solutions are just plug and play directly or with some limited interpretation (definite integrals) and being able to manipulate graphs and measure bounded space etc took a lot of the pressure off of harder problems. Often if I was kinda lost I\u2019d just start plotting the function and its derivatives, peek at the tables, seeing what jumped out.  For limits you can do most all of them on the calculator as long as you know the rules and techniques. It helped me understand visually what was going on when I studied as well. I\u2019m sure there are even more ways to use it. L\u2019hoptals rule is awesome as well if you are good at derivatives and having issues with algebra. For derivatives really nail down what particles are doing (speeding up slowing down moving forward backward etc) and recognize what the problem is asking for and how to get there.  You may get f\u2019\u2019 for example and have to solve for when velocity is a certain number, so you have to manipulate the function. Concavity is a hugely useful tool for narrowing down graphs too. For Integrals I recommend learning the table method from YouTube. It really made it click for me and on hard problems I could at least get partial answers that way when other stuff wasn\u2019t working. It sounds sort of obvious but the techniques you learn really do make life easier if you think about how they are applied across multiple problems. At first I was overwhelmed with all the concepts but I focused on getting really good at basic limits derivatives and later integrals. I drilled hundreds of of questions every day until I was comfortable. By the time I took the OA I didn\u2019t even need the formula sheet for 90% of things. That being said, if you are stuck, look at the sheet. Sometimes the answer is just straight up on there with a different variable letter or maybe a couple hops into trig identities. You will find through practice there are some \u201cclassic\u201d limits and derivatives and integrals that will make like so much easier. Look these up. \n\nAnything else feel free to ask!

Read up if I didn't feel confident, then take the questions at the end of each unit. In the later sections, I'd only watch the video at the top, then read the section - that felt like it worked the best for me.\n\nAs for the end of unit quiz, I took a single pass if I scored above a 60%. Anything less than 60% was a \"reread and retry immediately\". Once I finished all the units, I retook every unit quiz where I scored less than 80%, then took the PA and got Competent and Exemplary for each category. A simple review of the questions I missed before the OA was all that was needed.\n\nI'd say the OA fairly matched the PA and end of unit quizzes, so if you can do well on those, you should be fine. Some questions I recognized nearly word for word, others were very similar.\n\nAlso, Topics 1-6 are about 50% of the exam, and those were the hardest slog for me. Those sections have a lot of the formulas that will be on reference sheet during the exam, particularly the ratios. The biggest problem I had was remembering categorization - i.e. given a bunch of numbers, which ones were operating, investing, and financing; which were above the line and below the line, etc.\n\nThe only resources I used were the textbook and the embedded videos.\n\nBest of luck, and remember what Hawaiian Shirt Guy's brother says - if you're having problems remembering what something is, say it slowly.","permalink":"\/r\/WGU_MBA\/comments\/1lsfd5s\/c213_pass_tips\/","created_utc":1751736918,"score":7,"text_length":1668,"vader_compound":0.847,"course_code":"C213"}

{"post_id":"1lt4ol6","subreddit":"WGUCyberSecurity","title":"You Need Help w\/D488? This Might Help!","selftext":"So I would like to start this off by saying that I have taken the exam for D488, and I did fail. My original way of studying was just using the CertMaster information, and I started watching some of the Jason Dion videos, as his videos were a HUGE help for me when I took the PenTest+ exam (scored 768 with his help). When I took the D488 Pre-Assessment, I passed with flying colors! Now, you will see a bunch of posts that say the wording on the D488 exam is super vague, and I somewhat agree. I think they worked hard to throw in some words to trip you up on a lot of the questions, without a doubt. A quick example - typically, when we see the words \"source code analysis,\" we automatically think of \"Static analysis\". Well, you might see something like \"precompiled source code analysis,\" and you should be able to understand what is going on (that's just a small example). As I was taking the exam, I started thinking to myself, \"This is the last course that I have to take an exam in - after this course, it is just 2 papers. And this exam feels like a final exam for the whole program that incorporates a lot of the more important information to know\". With that, if you complete PenTest+ and feel pretty confident in the information you learned there, then you already have a head start, so now it is time to shift your focus to the newer stuff in this exam. So I'd like to point out a few things that should help you ***TREMENDOUSLY*** with passing this exam, as well as getting into some specifics:\n\n**My Tips for the Exam:**\n\n* The CertMaster material, although the information they give can help with some questions, seems like a complete waste of time...like, seriously...a waste of valuable time! I think this information is echoed through the mountains of D488 Reddit posts.\n* Head over to [**this Reddit post**](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Piracy\/comments\/14otpui\/where_do_you_people_find_ebooks_there_days\/) and use the **Anna's Archive** link > search for \"CASP+ Mark Birch\" > select that first option > You will see links for the book, look a little down and select \"**show external downloads**\" > select that Z-Library option, hit the EPUB download option and you might have to create an account. When you download the book, you can easily find an EPUB to PDF converter online.\n* The Mark Birch CAS-004 book is probably the best resource to use for this exam. I understand that not everyone here likes to read a lot, so here is a breakdown of the chapters that should lead you to pass!\n* Chapter 4: Deploying Enterprise Authentication and Authorization Controls\n* Chapter 1: Designing a Secure Network Architecture\n* Chapter 3: Enterprise Data Security\n* Chapter 2: Integrating Software Applications into the Enterprise\n* Chapter 5: Threat and Vulnerability Management\n* Chapter 6: Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing Methods and Tools\n* Chapter 9: Endpoint Security Controls\n* Chapter 10: Security Considerations Impacting Specific Sectors and Operational Technologies\n* Chapter 13: Risk Strategies\n* Chapter 14: Compliance Frameworks, Legal Considerations, and Their Organizational Impact\n* I put the chapters in some dumb order, but you can reorder them if you want. If you are a slow reader or prefer an audiobook, like me 100%, there is an app called O'Reilly with a perfect audiobook for this book, not that robot voice. This is helping me fly through the chapters and understand the material.\n* When reading the book, ALWAYS focus on key information like the fact that a password policy should not be set to something long like 15 characters because there is a chance the password will include repeated information like Reddit69Reddit15! \\* That is a very small example; however, I included it because it is a good example of something small in the book, but while you are reading, you should focus closely on the material like that.\n\nThis post has now exceeded the length I thought it would be (lol)! Go ahead and read those chapters in the book, and I can assure you will pass the exam.\n\n**\\*\\*Now, if you are reading this in late 2025 or in 2026, the information might have changed on the exam. Luckily, on Reddit, you are part of a LARGE community that will be able to let you know if it changed and guide you down the right path to study!\\*\\***\n\nWith that being said, Good Luck!!","permalink":"\/r\/WGUCyberSecurity\/comments\/1lt4ol6\/you_need_help_wd488_this_might_help\/","created_utc":1751817515,"score":19,"text_length":4255,"vader_compound":0.9974,"course_code":"D488"}

Especially if the test has an Operator precedence question, which can be different jumping from statistics, algebra, Python, Java, and now SQL. and a good example of this, I am in the Approaching competency bracket of D426 after. \n\nWhat I think there needs to be more of, Supplemental pretests, more transparency on study materials, because for 3 CU's, Data structures & Algorithms, Data management Foundations, and other classes are very definition heavy, meanwhile the the actual coded exam versions feel easier despite carrying 4 CUs, and bring back recorded cohorts, I don't think it's fair I'm watching stuff from C176 and having to guess what is relevant on the new version of the test and what isn't.\n\n  \nHope ya'll are enjoying the new courses and find them insightful, but I kinda wish they updated the new courses with new cohorts right out of the gate and more materials.

I enjoyed this class and the material for it. I think it can be really easy for most people. There are three tasks, all papers you'll need to write. Each paper is recommended to be 6-8 pages long, but my longest was 4 pages, so don't worry about the page length recommendation. I did roughly 1 paragraph to 1 rubric topic, made the headings literally \"Section A, Section B\" etc. I've found that makes it easy for the evaluators to grade you Competent for each rubric section.\n\nAlso, huge shout-out to the CI team and their videos. The lady (Dr. Springer?) does a great intro and overview video for each task, and the guy (never got his name) does great videos for each task section where he calls out specific pages to use in the book. My overall strategy was to watch the intro\/overview video for the task, open up a word doc, and write it while listening to the task section videos, reviewing the material.\n\nTask 1:  \nSection A asks you to talk about a leader and their ethical qualities. You can talk about someone famous, or someone you know. I'd say go with someone you know, simply for the fact that an evaluator can't disagree with the facts like they could if you talked about someone famous.  \nSection B is all about Consequentialism vs Deonotologicalism which the book covers really well, and how they apply to a given scenario.  \nSection C is matching statements to different stages of ethical development. Several times I used \"Stage # calls out <thing>, which this statement also mentioned, therefore I think this statement reflects Stage #\". I didn't just leave it at that, but would try to give another sentence to support it.   \nSection D was the most annoying. You have to go take an Ethical Lens Inventory quiz and write about it. I was half-asleep when I did my ELI and wrote a bit about how I disagreed with it. You can't retake it, so if you end up in a similar situation put a nice \"I didn't realize this about myself, I'm going to explore what this says about me\" spin on it.   \nOverall, this was 4 pages and took me a few hours.\n\nTask 2:  \nSection A asks you about the purpose of Corporate Social Responsibility and how a fictional company can meet their CSR for stakeholders that you identify. Pretty simple.  \nSection B is about the importance of ethical culture and developing it, as well as ethics audits.  \nSection C is probably the most fun and apparently the reason most people get their papers returned. You're going to have to come up with an ethical dilemma and evaluate two solutions. The examples you'll see are for small scale shit, don't do that. Go big or go home. The whole point of this section is to choose and defend a solution that you need to hate, simply because it's the better of two shit options. I chose child labor over environmental devastation for the toy company. Just have salient points and take a shower after.  \nSection D is a short writeup about how you would implement an ethics training program. If you've been in the corporate workforce, you've probably been exposed to an ethics training program and have probably complained about having to take your annual training. Now you're on the other side of it.  \nOverall, this was 2.25 pages, took a few hours, and got me an excellence award.\n\nTask 3:  \nThis was the hardest.   \nSection A: You're going to have to look at a company's code of ethics and how that code of ethics and talk about how it's helping them fulfill their CSR and legal compliance. The most ethical company from the list might be the Mayo Clinic, but theirs was too long. I chose Comcast because it was super short and I'm a freaking masochist. Comcast's Code of Ethics is only concerned about maintaining legal compliance, but I had to spin some topics to fit different portions of the CSR pyramid - their philanthropic responsibilities were met with \"Don't destroy the environment because it's illegal\".  \nSection B is all about how to whistleblow. Pretty simple thanks to the video and the book.  \nSection C is about making money from whistleblowing, which is an interesting topic and tactic for the government to take.  \nSection D is about the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines. This one was incredibly simple thanks to the section video and the book.  \nOverall, 3 pages and a few hours.\n\n  \nI don't know exactly how the course will change after August 4th, but I'm confident that as long as the CI team stays the same, they'll create the same kind of videos.\n\nHere's the link to the recorded videos page so you don't have to deal with WGUConnect.  \n[https:\/\/westerngovernorsuniversity.sharepoint.com\/:w:\/r\/sites\/C206-EthicalLeadership\/\\_layouts\/15\/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B1B6FC8A3-675A-455A-B4F9-67C7FB7472B2%7D&file=C206%20Recorded%20Videos.docx&action=default&mobileredirect=true&web=1](https:\/\/westerngovernorsuniversity.sharepoint.com\/:w:\/r\/sites\/C206-EthicalLeadership\/_layouts\/15\/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B1B6FC8A3-675A-455A-B4F9-67C7FB7472B2%7D&file=C206%20Recorded%20Videos.docx&action=default&mobileredirect=true&web=1)  \nI did all 6 Crash Course recordings and all of the Task recordings.\n\n","permalink":"\/r\/WGU_MBA\/comments\/1ly4p1e\/c206_pass_and_tips\/","created_utc":1752337939,"score":8,"text_length":4684,"vader_compound":0.9988,"course_code":"C206"}

{"post_id":"1lyk4pk","subreddit":"wgueducation","title":"For anyone struggling with C165 - Integrated Physical Science","selftext":"This is the first course that actually freaked me out before I even started the class. Everything I saw regarding C165 was about how difficult it was to pass. SO if this is you now take this post as your sign that you can and will pass this class on the first try. I will preface this by saying that I am extremely type A and some of the steps I list below are extremely tedious, so take what resonates. \n\n**Here are some tips that worked for me** *(btw I started the class on 7\/9\/25 and passed 7\/12\/25-exemplary)*\n\n**Step 1**: (This is the most time consuming step for me) I literally go through the entire course material and *copy + paste* into a word doc. For this course I made 3 word docs for the 3 sections. Then, I upload the docs to good ol chatGPT and I ask it to \"Teach me Section X - very in depth\".\n\n**Step 2**: Usually if the course I'm taking has a performance assessment, I just use the chatGPT lessons to write my notes, learn the material and complete my assessments. If the Course has an OA (Like C165) I skip step 2 and go to step 3. Reason being that I learn better by applying knowledge, I feel it equips me better to take an exam and it helps me accelerate. \n\n**Step 3**: I find a Pre-Assessment on [quizlet](https:\/\/quizlet.com\/1052056072\/c165-pre-test-flash-cards\/?funnelUUID=c517e1c0-863e-400e-8b32-ae8559bf6b07) or studocu and upload those questions + answers to chatGPT. Then I ask it \"Can you thoroughly explain the topics related to each question and answer, based on the course material docs? I want to see what topic it's related to, what the question is asking, and why that is the answer. And can you also include the questions and answers in your response?\", I use chatGPT's responses as my new and improved course material, tailored to PA questions. I take notes, I ask questions, I review why this is the answer, I memorize the mnemonic devices, etc. \n\n\\*This isn't meant to help me *memorize* the PA questions, instead it helps me apply the course material to the scenarios and questions. By the time I take the PA & OA, even though the questions are different, I'm able to pick apart each question to understand what topic it's testing me on, so I can recall that information. I see SO many posts where people struggle with the scenarios in the OA- that's because you're learning the material but you're not understanding examples or applying what you've learned. Studying the material via the PA questions will be a game changer if that's you.\\*\n\n**Step 4**: Before I take the OA, I usually do one final overview of everything\/last study sesh (see picture), review anything that I'm iffy on, review my mnemonic devices and then I just trust myself and take the exam. \n\nFor C165 this is the [quizlet ](https:\/\/quizlet.com\/1052056072\/c165-pre-test-flash-cards\/?funnelUUID=c517e1c0-863e-400e-8b32-ae8559bf6b07)I used to study the PA questions.

Baby needs to eat every 2 hours and sometimes sooner, he's fussy if I put him down, I didn't put the kids in summer activities so that I can have more time so they're off playing with the neighbors most of the time, but I still have my 2 year old at hime, she mostly does independent play. My husband just got a new computer and keeps complaining that he needs a break and just bought a call of duty game a couple of days ago and he's basically stuck on that and asks me when im going to study so he can play outside those times. I deal with demand avoidance and can't force myself to study if I'm feeling pushed to do it by someone else. yesterday he said he was going to make dinner and I sent him the recipes and everything but he was stuck on his game so I ended up making dinner instead of studying after asking him multiple times and we didn't end up eating until bedtime. I'm not sleeping, barely eating enough, and I need to get this course done.\n\nI might end up deleting this post because this is all so embarrassing but I feel like I need to explan why I've not been able t finish a course in so long when it really should be so simple.","permalink":"\/r\/WGU\/comments\/1lzpaug\/if_i_cannot_complete_a_course_even_after_getting\/","created_utc":1752506602,"score":1,"text_length":1643,"vader_compound":-0.7163,"course_code":"D564"}

Tips","selftext":"https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/whwjndhsh1df1.png?width=2313&format=png&auto=webp&s=50784765e716b062c6b6ad2d5e36c8436f910846\n\n**This course was easy but I made one major mistake!**\n\nFirst of all, I had to take a term off. I was hired as a software engineer last year so I had to slow down my progress a bit. I kinda did this backwards, I completed the advanced Java courses before this one (My SWE job is focused on backend dev work in Java). \n\nThis was my second attempt, I had my first attempt last year and failed by one question. I was in absolute shock. I felt so good about the OA, it was not hard at all. Had to do the whole retake plan which was an absolute nightmare. **Only to realize I never \"tested\" my code during the OA.** I didn't realize I could enter user input to ensure that my output matches the sample output exactly. On my second attempt I tested my code and got a 100. If you even miss a an extra white space, the whole question will be marked wrong. Pay attention to \"ending with a new line\" (System.out.println). **So please test your code! This will tell you if it's correct or not!**\n\n\n\n**OA:**\n\nThe OA pretty much mirrors the PA. The 14 questions lab at the end of the Zybooks are the PA so do those over and over. The OA takes the PA and makes some minor tweaks. For example, instead of creating a program that multiplies int's together you may be asked something like add them or subtract them. Or the variable names will be different but it will be the same exact question as the PA. A lot of the answers are in the question themselves or lets say you forget the correct syntax for setters and getters, well a lot of the end questions 10-14 will have the syntax for those. **The key is to master the PA and what I mean by that is to not only memorize it but know the logic (the why's and how's).** So take each question and the code then feed it into chatgpt and tell it to teach you the concepts around that question. If it deals with Arrays then have it teach you arrays based on that question. THEN have it create 2-3 different ways that question can be tweaked and solve those. This will prepare you for the OA. Let's say instead what the PA does \"if the a number is divisible by 3\" you have chatgpt create a problem that asks \"if the number is negative\". If you do this, you will have no trouble on the OA. Have chatgpt create a mock OA for you. \n\n**Prep:**  \nAside from the Labs and my required retake plan, I didn't touch the ZyBooks. I refreshed my fundamentals in Java with hyperskill backend track. (MOOC would be another good one for this OA). Or for free \"Bro Code\" on youtube. Just find the time stamps and line them up with the PA questions (Arrays, Strings, and so on). I made my code for solving the PA questions as simple as possible! Some can be solved a variety of ways but I made it as error proof as possible. Even if it wasn't the most \"efficient\" way to solve it.  \n\n**Conclusion:** \n\nIf this is your first Java course and you plan on going into software engineering or a programming job after graduating, please take your time and learn the fundamentals of Java. It will pay off for the remaining courses and your future. Even if it takes an extra month take your time and get a solid foundation in Java. **If you have any questions on how I solved any of the PA questions feel free to ask!**","permalink":"\/r\/WGU_CompSci\/comments\/1m0ipfv\/d286_java_fundamentals_passed_with_exemplary_tips\/","created_utc":1752588423,"score":11,"text_length":3274,"vader_compound":0.9887,"course_code":"D286"}

{"post_id":"1m0j0r8","subreddit":"WGU_MBA","title":"C211 Passed first try- LOADS of studying.","selftext":"Hello lovely Reddit! \nI THANKFULLY passed c211 at my first go at it. I will say, WGU is known to have different versions of the Exam, and I truly believe I got extremely lucky with my version because it was EXACTLY like the PA. \nI studied for over a month tbh, but I didn't actually buckle down and focus until like a three week interval. I'd take about eight hours on Saturday and 8 on Sunday studying. The things I did to study and the things guaranteed to work: \n\n- Learn the WHY. Find examples! Make it make sense to you in real life and not just as class material. Please the best advice you should ever take from any reddit thread and the question I asked myself taking the OA was ' why'. And for the PA when I realized I couldn't say ' why' I went back and studied it! \n\n-Never in my life did I think I'd use ChatGPT, but listen...do NOT listen to the people who knock ChatGPT or judge or dismiss it outright. ChatGPT gets a bad rep because there are people who ABUSE it and use it to cheat. That will NOT help you. BUT LISTEN, ChatGPT can help break down concepts in a way and provide examples to really help you understand the materials! It even gives you graph examples and tells you why the other answers are wrong. Use this for concepts you can't come up with a ' why' for yourself! I only needed to use it for Compt 3, so don't feel like you'll be glued to it or anything. \n\n-Be familiar with the graphs ( there are no graphs on the exam) but being able to graph them on the white board is very helpful with the ' why' on competency 3 and 4. \n\n- Think of some things as ' common sense' once you learn it, some of it will click and go ' ohhhh' because it'll start to make logical sense. Ofc if the Fed lowers IR then the banks can give more money increasing money supply. Ofc a Monopolistic market wouldn't be efficient, they don't have to be and can raise price to the demon curve and lower quantity to just what benefits them because consumers don't have an alternative. But it also makes sense that they can't produce as much as they want unlike perfect competition , because if they want to produce MORE they have to lower the price of EVERY unit not just the extra unit they want to sell due to the downward sloping curve. But their goal is profit maximization so they'll produce less. \n\n- The V4 study guide was incredibly helpful! Don't just answer the questions, give examples and give the WHY. There's a prefilled one, BUT use the unfilled one, use the cohort videos to answer the questions, THEN use the prefilled one to fill in any gaps and give extra examples. \n\n-I didn't actually read much in the textbook except when I needed examples and charts\/graphs or the videos didn't say something. Like on the PA they ask about mercantilism, but the videos barely talk about it. \n\n-Remember every political system has some degree of political risk, others just have MORE. \n\n-The QUIZZES and the ' pre-OA' tests are very helpful ways for you to practice your Why paired with the study guide paired with the PA. \n\n-I took a long time because I'm a procrastinator, but 4 weeks of SOLID study, I mean even if you work full time take two hours a day to study on days you work and grind on free days,will be more than enough to grasp it down. There are cases ofc where some concepts are harder for people to grasp, so do NOT rush yourself if you feel you are not ready because trust me accounting stressed me so much I got a literal hole in my throat and flew to Japan for two weeks and came back and ignored it for two more weeks before passing that exam. But breathe, trust yourself and know that WGU is designed for busy people and designed to be forgiving and you can always try again. \ud83d\udc95\n\nAnyways on to my capstone!

Normally, I would ignore the latter opinions and assume that these were people who simply didn't study at all or that they are simply bad test takers, but this exam seemed different in that people with a lot of experience in IT or people who also seemed to pass exams with no issues were struggling with this one. \n\nOn top of that, it had been a few months since I took the last of the CompTIA trifecta exams, and knowing a lot of material would be overlap, I found this test to be very difficult to study for. I didn't want to sit through a 17 hour long Udemy course on information that I mostly knew, and I also really didn't have the motivation to read a long book about info that again, I was already mostly familiar with and just needed a refresh for. It was very tough finding material that I thought would teach me what I needed to know without a ton of information that I didn't need. **Here is what I used and what I would recommend using now that I've taken the test:**\n\n***WannabeaSSCP Udemy Course:*** I listened to this at 1.75x speed in the background while doing chores. It was a good refresher for concepts that I forgot a bit of, I think. I'm not really sure how useful it was in the end to be honest.\n\n***Certprep practice tests:*** Definitely use these. There are people saying that these don't prepare you for the exam, and I think that's because there is more info on the exam than there is on these practice tests, but that goes for any practice tests. These are worded very similarly to the actual exam and definitely help prepare you for a decent amount of the questions. However, **these practice tests are very light on BCP, DRP, IAM, change management, and other program management questions.** If you are like me, and don't know a lot about these programs, you should seek out more materials that cover them. **Managing these programs, their lifecycles and phases, etc. are a huge part of the test.** \n\n***Cybervista practice exam:*** I didn't watch the course, but I did the practice exam until I had gone through all of the possible questions that it could give me. I highly recommend this as well, it will definitely help identify areas of knowledge that you lack so you can review them further.\n\n***Gibson all-in-one study guide:*** I didn't use this, but I recommend that you do. **You should use this to review areas that the cybervista exams show you are weak in** so that you don't waste your time reading the whole thing. This is what I would do with the information that I know now.\n\n***Mike Chapple Last Minute Study Guide:*** I through this the last couple days before my exam. I thought it was very useful and covered concepts that I hadn't previously seen through the other materials I used.\n\n  \n**The exam itself:** I hate to say it, but **I definitely found this exam to be a struggle.** A portion of the test felt so easy that I felt like I was being tricked, some of it was easy because I knew the information from other course, some of it felt quite difficult because there would be 2 answers that both made sense to me, and then yet another bit of it just felt completely out of left field. Like others have said, there were many topics that overlap with the CompTIA certs, but a lot of the test is about the management side of IT, which I honestly wasn't expecting.\n\nFrom my point of view, if you are like me, and **you already have A+, Net+, and Sec+, you know most of the info on this test,** but you should **absolutely take the time to fully understand Risk Management lifecycles, change management, identity management, disaster recovery plans, business continuity plans and the like.**  ","permalink":"\/r\/WGUCyberSecurity\/comments\/1m493zh\/sscp_c845_passed\/","created_utc":1752964694,"score":24,"text_length":4591,"vader_compound":0.9793,"course_code":"C845"}

I don't know what's going to change with the course after August 4th, but I think it'll be an improvement.\n\nThe text for this is an aggregate of two different books, so you'll see things like (Mankiw Ch.23) and (Peng Ch.4), and sometimes just (Ch 21) (Ch 13). I'm not a huge fan of it based on the way I studied.\n\nThe way I studied:  \nI saw other posts talking about the recorded cohorts, and they're pretty good but have room for improvement. For me, Dr. Roberts' videos were too quiet, and Dr. Baraghoshi was a bit too slow and not really engaging. What worked(ish) for me was watching the videos once or twice each, then taking the end-of-chapters proficiency quizzes - most videos cover multiple, nonsequential chapters. I also found the end of chapter quizzes had questions about things that weren't in the videos (or at least that I could find when I watched it again) - same for the PA\/OA. I felt the books were definitely necessary to passing, it just wasn't well organized. I'm really hoping they fix this in August.\n\nAfter a few days of off-and-on videos, quizzes, and book reading, I took the PA and passed. Scheduled the OA for 2 days later, and started working the v4 study guide while I rewatched videos. This really showed the weakness of the videos to me, because there were things on the study guide that weren't explained by the videos themselves and I had to go digging through the textbook chapters to fill out.\n\nI was using this list of recorded cohorts as my guide - [https:\/\/westerngovernorsuniversity-my.sharepoint.com\/:w:\/g\/personal\/marie\\_reymore\\_wgu\\_edu\/Efnw4Evzbu5Ivm3-cex2NBEBX-mmBF64-UTgrBLYNJp76g](https:\/\/westerngovernorsuniversity-my.sharepoint.com\/:w:\/g\/personal\/marie_reymore_wgu_edu\/Efnw4Evzbu5Ivm3-cex2NBEBX-mmBF64-UTgrBLYNJp76g)\n\nOne of the problems I have with it is that it makes it appear that Competencies 3 & 4 are the most tested because they've got 3-5 hours of video. In actuality, Competencies 1 & 2 make up 50% of the exam and the three videos that cover them are less than an hour total.\n\nOverall, this course took me about 7 days. It has interesting material and concepts that are hindered by their presentation.

{"post_id":"1m2sn5l","subreddit":"wguaccounting","title":"D216 - Business Law for Accountants OA","selftext":"I wanted to hope on here and give my insights on this class. I passed this class in 10 days and knew nothing about this topic. Passed 1st try. Like everyone says - the PA isn\u2019t the best judgement of what the OA will be like, but the way the questions are asked is similar - but if you know the material I would say it aligns somewhat well. (Unpopular opinion). \n\nI read both the textbook, filled out the study guides for each chapter and watched Elon\u2019s videos. The most important things I would say you need from this course was Elon\u2019s videos and review the D216 outline. If you don\u2019t read the textbook I think you can pass this class if you understand the videos and the outline in and out. \n\nIf I had to take this class again I would watch each unit video, then review the outline that goes along with it with some notes on important things Elin mentions. Repeat with every unit. If you have the videos and outline down and understand it watch the cohort review videos that goes over some PA questions along with the questions elin comes up with. She comes up with some I saw similar on the OA - and it solidified what I knew \/ was missing. I wouldn\u2019t read the the textbook or do the guides with it unless you don\u2019t feel confident with the material they may be helpful. \n\nOverall this class looked overwhelming at the beginning, but if you put time in to watch her videos and know the outline like the back of your hand - not memorizing it but just understanding the concepts you can pass this class. You\u2019ll be able to easily pass with process of elimination which she talks about. \n\nI think the people who fail the OA just didn\u2019t put much time into and looked at other people who said they passed in 5 days or whatever and\u2019s assumed it was an easy class. It is, but as long as you understand the concepts and review. Review. Review. I just listened to Elins videos while at work just to solidify information. \n\nThis class isn\u2019t to bad, don\u2019t rush it or there is a good chance you might fail the OA. Don\u2019t overlook it, but also don\u2019t be afraid of the OA if you feel confident knowing and understanding the outline from her videos. \n\n","permalink":"\/r\/wguaccounting\/comments\/1m2sn5l\/d216_business_law_for_accountants_oa\/","created_utc":1752812014,"score":28,"text_length":2178,"vader_compound":0.9803,"course_code":"D216"}

The class is a lot of information and it's easy to get lost in the reading. I went through every section and touched on the main points of the section by skimming. I got a brief idea and then worked through the quizzes using them as a guide. If there was something in the quiz I was completely unsure of I went back into the reading to find that section and would go over the main ideas again. The quizzes are a huge help. Typically I will have ChatGPT give me example questions on a subject to help me get the understanding but I rarely had to do that with this class because the quizzes were a great study guide. \n\nI didn't take the PA until I had gone through every section and got at least an 80% on the quizzes. Once I did that I felt confident. I took the PA on 7\/17 around 8pm and passed Competent. I took the OA this morning (7\/18) and passed Exemplary and only spent 34 minutes on the exam. The OA and PA are extremely similar and there were questions in the OA that came directly from those imbedded quizzes. \n\nHeavily focus on data collection methods, bias in data collections, types of data, graphical displays and interpretation, theoretical and empirical probability, independent dependent and disjoint events, and expected value. If you can pass the PA you will be golden for the OA.

Here's exactly what I would recommend doing to effectively pass and learn the material: \n\n1. 1st thing I did was email my professor to introduce myself and ask for a game plan. I let them know I planned on accelerating through this course and asked for recommendations on how to do that successfully. The professor group ended up responding and sent me the resources like \"Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader?\" and some other previously recorded Cohorts. \n\n2. Use the course material to complete Task 1 & 2 ASAP. You'll actually need to listen to all the videos posted, and read the material within those two sections to understand and pass those task. Follow the rubric to the T. If you have issues or your assignments have been returned, make a 15-minute appointment with your professor. My task 2 was returned only once, and I was able to resubmit in 5 min after my meeting. \n\n3. Once I passed those tasks, I literally jumped into the recorded cohorts. I wrote notes, and I also took the chapter quizzes within the course material. I used AI to explain concepts to me like I'm 5, and asked it to quiz me on the concepts I had trouble grasping. \n\n(I found the actual course material pass section to be really bulky idk it didn't help in my studies. I supplemented my learning w\/ the recordings and AI.)\n\n4. Right before I took the PA, I listened to the \"Are You Smarter\" video & OMG, that was really helpful.

I also have a masters degree from a traditional college in a liberal arts field.  No transfer credits from Sophia or the like.  I contemplated trying to knock out some business courses through those venues, but for my own reasons just decided to do it all at WGU.  \n\nI have no formal accounting experience, but a lot of business experience and quite a bit of accounting adjacent experience.  I was working full time March & April, and not working May- July.  I intentionally selected my start date to align with a period off work, which I think resulted in my procrastinating a bit in March & April as I told myself I would focus on classes when I wasn't working.  May - July I studied most days, but not every day.  I took two week long trips during that time and had holidays, birthdays, weddings etc that pulled me away.  I tried to be serious about studying, but also not to burn myself out.  I have no kids at home, and an incredibly supportive spouse.\n\nThings that helped me before my term started:\n\n* I watched the full 10 hour Tony Bell Financial Accounting Course on 1.5 speed. I actually had his A=L+E diagram as my computer wallpaper for a while.  I also downloaded the free workbook from his site and completed questions prior to watching him work through them.\n* I completed the PA's for 3 of my first 5 classes before my term started. \n\nThings that helped me the entire term:\n\n* I watched all videos from 1.5x to 2x speed depending on the natural speed of the speaker.  \n* I searched all courses on Reddit prior to starting and eventually learned to look for consensus recommendations.  I also learned not to psych myself out about courses people were reporting to be especially hard, as we are all approaching this material from different places.  \n* In OA classes, I did the PA immediately.  I did not generally use the PA to study, and after a cursory look at how I did, would not look at it again until I took it again, usually right before I took the OA.  This was more about managing my expectations for the course and helping me key into materials when I was studying. I was not just trying to learn the PA to pass, but to learn the actual material.  Except for D101.  That's the only course I would say just study from the PA because the course material is pretty bad, in my opinion.  I made a whole post about the course you can see from my profile if you're interested.  \n* I was really intentional about study time.  If I only had an hour, or something was happening at my house that I would find distracting, I would not study.  I would do laundry or other things that needed to be done, so I wouldn't have to do them later and could focus on studying.  Focused study with replication in different mediums was really integral to my success, especially as the courses got harder.  So using D101 as an example, I wanted to read the job order costing text, watch the embedded videos, do the learning checks and quizzes\/tests, watch any supplemental WGU videos, do related study guide questions if available, all in one sitting.  I found it really helped me to interact with the material in multiple ways to get it to cement in my brain.  \n* I took OA's when I got exemplary on PA's.  So I would start the course and take the PA, then study, then retake the PA.  If I got exemplary I would schedule the OA.  If I didn't, I would review thoroughly what I missed, and then schedule the OA.  I did not want to have to do retakes with study plans from instructors.  \n* On performance assessment courses, I always double checked the rubric before submitting.  I wrote to the rubrics.  Even when it was (SO!) duplicative, even when the questions were not the most relevant to evidence learning, I wrote to the rubric. \n* I tried to pass PA's even when I had never touched the course material.  I think Dr. P talks about how accounting often names things reflective of what they are.  I genuinely tried to use deductive reasoning to pass every initial PA, either by reasoning through terms or process of elimination of answer choices.  The program is definitely additive, and I was always surprised from one course to the next how many terms or ideas concepts I recognized.  \n* If there were study guides, I did them.  All of them (except for inventory which was a poor choice!).  And If I didn't feel I had command of them, I did the areas again I was unsure of.  I would do a question, and then check the answer immediately so I could catch errors right away.  \n* In general, my approach to each course was PA --> read the text --> do all learning checks, quizzes, tests -->watch supplemental WGU videos --> watch supplemental materials as recommended on Reddit --> complete the study guides --> PA --> OA.  I never did a live cohort, nor did I ever have to meet with a Professor, but I would have if I thought they would have helped me complete the course. \n* I timed courses intentionally and did not try to take many OA's at the beginning or end of the month.  There was only one time where I was unable to take an OA within 2 hours of wanting to schedule it - make sure you stay on top of the Proctor maintenance schedule too.   \n* My initial goal was to be done a month early, as I did not want to be panicking in my last few weeks.  I know releasing courses can get a bit trickier in the last two weeks of a term, so I wanted to be done well ahead of that. \n* I did not tinker with the schedule of classes my mentor gave me except for occasionally moving a performance assessment course up a bit to stretch a different part of my brain.  I figured I have to complete them all anyway, I'm not going to waste a lot of time second guessing my mentor.  \n* Turn off the setting in the course community that emails you every time someone posts!  I also made sure to leave the course community each time I finished a course.  \n* Just start, and keep going.  My first two months when I was working, I would go days without logging in.  And the longer the delay, the harder it became mentally to get back into the right mindset.  \n\nOutside resources that were helpful (the first 4 are on You Tube);\n\n* Tony Bell financial and management accounting \n* Edspira for leases and auditing\n* Farhat for general questions or to reinforce concepts\n* Dr Haywood for Operations Management\n* Occasionally I checked on Quizlet or Studocu, but other peoples study materials have never been terribly helpful to me.  I have good retention skills and generally learn best by reading\/interacting with the material myself.  But if they are helpful to you there are a lot of resources on both you can find by searching the course number or title.  \n* MathGPT.  I used this carefully as I know LLM's cannot fully be relied upon.  But to understand a question, it can be very helpful.  I had less success asking it to make me new questions to study from.  \n* Not an outside resource but Elin's videos for taxation and business law\n\nMy mentor was AWESOME.  If yours is not, I recommend asking to switch.  She was a great resource, cheerleader and incredibly responsive making sure I always had courses to work on.  I tried to have 2 courses available all the time, so if there was a delay in scheduling an OA, or if I was waiting for PA, I would never be without something to do.  After we established a relationship, my mentor was great about allowing me to have 2-4 open classes all the time.  She did tell me that one of the reasons she was okay with that was that I never had an OA retake, and I never had a PA returned.  \n\nWatching my degree plan whittle down from four terms to one was a huge motivator for me, as was not paying for a 2nd term.  I found that closer I got to completion, the more motivated I became.  I'm grateful that WGU affords this opportunity to capitalize on the experience we have, and work at a pace that matches our lives.  \n\nI'm happy to try and answer any other questions.  Good luck to all of you, in whatever time frame you are completing.  I would not have been able to do this working full time, and I have tremendous respect for those juggling work, kids and WGU at one time. These tips are just the things that worked for me - I know success will look different for all of us.  \n\nMy plans now are to complete the CPA exams.

{"post_id":"1mcuzpl","subreddit":"WGU_Psychology","title":"Start and Complete D582 in 8 hours or less","selftext":"Hi!\n\nI made this comment but figured I would make a post so for people to see better (: \n\n1. I have a pro chat gpt account . You probably don\u2019t need one because you won\u2019t be uploading any pictures or anything but just an FYI. I use it as a study Buddy and a tutor because I study late nights and I can\u2019t wait a day to have every little question I have answered (because I have many usually) . \n\n2. Create a pdf of all the chapter objectives. Or a note, I just use my phone. \n\n3. Give the objectives and get a full on lesson from chat gpt on each area. I made it teach one by one and I didn\u2019t move on to the next until I was able to answer 5 practice questions it gave. \n\n4. At the end of each section I took the quizzes in the book. \n\nTip : don\u2019t waste time learning actual formulas. Think of this as a class where you need to know the definitions. Yes there are some questions asking about the formulas but not enough to stress over. If you want to hear them that\u2019s on you. Also I asked chat gpt to give me \u201chard fast rules.\u201d so i didn\u2019t have to remember formulas. \n\nFor example, \n\nAfter learning statistical significance when interpreting p-values, I was able to come up with this :\n\n\u201cPopular kids (aka SIGNIFICANT people) don\u2019t hang out with ZEROs. If they did they are not significant anymore.\u201d\n\nHow to apply that:\n\nA researcher wants to know if a new diet plan helps people lose more weight than the standard plan. They run a study and calculate a p-value of 0.02 when comparing the average weight loss between the two groups.\n\nUsing a significance level of \u03b1 = 0.05, what should the researcher conclude?\n\nA. There is not enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis.\nB. The difference in weight loss is likely due to chance.\nC. The results are statistically significant.\nD. The p-value shows that the diet plan had no effect.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t read the question at all, I just went straight to the numbers. I know that I\u2019m a number line .02 and .05 don\u2019t have zero between them so they are still popular (significant) . The answer is C. \n\nThis might sound confusing now but when you can jump in and apply real concepts and your own ways to remember it all starts to make sense. It\u2019s not as scary of a class as you may think. \n\nHere is proof of when I opened the class vs when i passed the test btw for anyone doubting\u2026 you can do it! \n\n\n\n\n","permalink":"\/r\/WGU_Psychology\/comments\/1mcuzpl\/start_and_complete_d582_in_8_hours_or_less\/","created_utc":1753842920,"score":4,"text_length":2369,"vader_compound":0.9794,"course_code":"D582"}

When I looked up the class I realized that there were many different things that I could do to try to get through this class and I felt that they were all over the place so I began to feel a little overwhelmed. The class has a lot of material but the good thing is that it is not difficult to understand. I will say that it also involves quite a bit of critical thinking and I was not expecting that when I began to take the Practice Exams but you will get used to those type of questions the more you take them. This class took me three months to complete, a little bit too long in my opinion but life happened and I went on vacation for a week so that ended up setting me back about two weeks. All I used for this class was:\n\n* CompTIA Certmaster\n* The practice Exams from CompTIA\n* The practice Exams from Pluralsight\n\nI went through all 14 lessons first on certmaster and as I went through the lesson I would take notes on definitions and what I thought was important. Once I completed the lesson I would take the practice quiz for it and I would review the output given for the answers. I really liked that about the quizzes because it gave you definitions and explained the answers.\n\nOnce I finished going through all 14 lessons I went through the quizzes again, repetition seems to be what helps me. So I went through the answers explanation again and reviewed things that I had forgotten about lol\n\nAfter that I decided to take a practice exam on Pluralsight, but I failed to realize that the exam has 90 questions and you have an hour and a half to take it. I scored super low, and decided to adjust the quizzes to 15 questions since I did not really enjoy sitting under pressure for 1.5 hours. Did that for a few days and I would take about 3 or 4 quizzes a day and review all the answers.\n\nI studied for about 3 more days after this, drew all the cycles and wrote down the 11 steps to the \"Change Control Process\" which you definitely need to know. (I wrote the mnemonic in parenthesis that was given in the CBT course to remember the 12 steps). The change control process video in the CBT course was the only thing I watched in that course, so I do not recommend spending money on it. \n\nAnd I finally took the test on a Friday and passed with a 717.

I printed the study guide and took notes over the cohorts, watching at 1.75x. Took PA and passed. Reviewed right and wrong questions and reviewed the two sections I wasnt competent in. Took practice test 1 and passed, did the same thing. I looked over the practice questions and enrolled in the OA cohort. Took the OA right after.\n\nAll the practice questions and cohorts were extremely helpful in what was needed for the test. Most important concepts are the phases of project management including documents in each, WBS, and triple constraints. Earned value management you DONT NEED EQUATIONS. You just need to know what they mean (Study the ones from Carlos Garcias cohorts). Only equations you would need is P*S and the triangular\/beta equations. Know Gantt charts and how to translate them into a calendarized budget and how to determine critical path.\n\nOnly part that tripped me up is there were 2 questions on the stages of Prince2 and I hadnt studied that at all. \n\nIf you can, go to the OA prep cohort because it is extremely helpful in highlighting what concepts would be found on the test and how the test asks questions. \n\nThe test will try to trick you by giving more information than you need.

I kept repeating that loop until I felt fully confident.\n\nYou can absolutely do this if you stick with it and stay focused.

I then asked Claude to make me tests based on the three practice exams to ask me the questions one at a time I would do 25 questions 30 questions 40 questions.

Another big key is that during the test and the pre-assessment for that matter you are given example SQL commands and the syntax, which for me was key.

As you can see I passed by the skin of my teeth on my first try. Although there's already a very good reddit post that I'll link below I think this may help for people that will begin V3 and not V2. I'll try to keep this short and recommend you a path to pass this class.\n\nFirst I recommend you to either read through the Zybooks material or watch the Caleb Curry series. I know the Zybooks material is boring, but trust me, all the information you need really is in there. And with the release of V3 the material is even shorter than V2. But yeah, you can either choose to watch the videos or do the readings it's up to you but for sure start there to gain an understanding.\n\nI'd say that finishing that is the beginning, next step is going through the red text study guide that everyone talks about for this course. A lot of the material that shows up on the OA is within that study guide. To help reinforce that information you can use a Quizlet that I will post below. I personally have Quizlet+ so I just used the learn function.\n\nThat was pretty much it, I had used some other videos that I'll link below but the main information you need to know is in the stuff I talked about above.\n\n**In regards to the OA and what was on it, I recommend you to focus on certain things:**\n\n* Joins, dear god the OA I took had an absurd amount of questions on Joins. Know how the different types of joins and the syntax for them.\n* 1NF, 2NF, 3NF, and Boyce-Codd Normal Form. There were quite a few questions on these.\n* Make sure you understand one-one, one-many- and many-many.\n* Syntax, I wouldn't say that you need to know how to write them but for sure know what they look like and how things are ordered as well how to read and understand them. Like when you read this you should understand it:SELECT Department.Name AS Team, Employee.Name AS Supervisor FROM Department, Employee WHERE Manager = ID;\n* Keys, keys are very important and there were quite a few questions on them as well. I think the majority of my OA was joins and keys honestly. I'll link a helpful video below.\n* Although I didn't get any questions on the database phases I think you should memorize them, they might be on another test version. These would be like Analysis, Logical, and Physical. I personally drilled this in with the help of the quizlet.\n* ER Diagrams and the symbols related to them.\n* Indexes\n* Know unary and binary as well the operators\/expressions like =, %, \\*\n* There were a few questions on the database sub languages, so like DTL, DML, DDL.\n* Also quite a few questions about Cardinality\n* I had like one or two questions on single-level indexes, so section 5.2 in Zybooks\n* Also a few questions on Strong and Weak entities as well as supertye and subtype entities.\n\nThat's all I can honestly remember. I wish you all good luck, if you have any questions you can post them below and I'll try to get back to you. I might not remember stuff after a while though, lol.\n\n**I'll link all the material I used below:**\n\nZybooks: In the Course Material, I don't gotta link that\n\nCaleb Curry Playlist: [https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/playlist?list=PL\\_c9BZzLwBRK0Pc28IdvPQizD2mJlgoID](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/playlist?list=PL_c9BZzLwBRK0Pc28IdvPQizD2mJlgoID)\n\nRed Text Study Guide: [https:\/\/docs.google.com\/document\/d\/1Qg\\_qw11147OIYIcrfrLGlkcH\\_zAVKK0J\/edit?tab=t.0](https:\/\/docs.google.com\/document\/d\/1Qg_qw11147OIYIcrfrLGlkcH_zAVKK0J\/edit?tab=t.0)\n\nRed Text Study Guide Quizlet: [https:\/\/quizlet.com\/933592685\/d426-study-guide-red-text-only-flash-cards](https:\/\/quizlet.com\/933592685\/d426-study-guide-red-text-only-flash-cards)\n\nDecomplexify video on Keys: [https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=8wUUMOKAK-c](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=8wUUMOKAK-c)\n\nOriginal reddit thread I used for help: [https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/WGU\/comments\/13kp9hn\/d426\\_v2\\_data\\_management\\_foundations\\_here\\_is\\_how\\_i](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/WGU\/comments\/13kp9hn\/d426_v2_data_management_foundations_here_is_how_i)\n\nAnother reddit thread I had used for help: [https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/WGU\/comments\/1ia3ce1\/passed\\_d426\\_data\\_management\\_foundations](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/WGU\/comments\/1ia3ce1\/passed_d426_data_management_foundations)\n\nThis is a cheat sheet that seemed useful but I honestly didn't use at all.

It's the very last section at the bottom. It mimics the practice exam. Be sure to know what it's doing. \n\nAsk chatgpt to explain each line to you step by step. This helped a ton when studying. \n\nWhen you're actively writing a line a code, explain to yourself out loud what you're doing. \"If x is greater than 5 then print true. Else print false.\" You wouldn't believe how much this helps you learn and memorize the material.\n\nMake sure you know all of the import math module because it is an easy question you can miss on the exam. My question was harder than the one from the practice exam and I sweated for 30 minutes before I stumbled into the correct output.\n\nBe sure to know how to pull the integer location from lists and dictionaries. In the practice exam, it has you put in a integer to pull out the item in the list at that integer location. The exam had me go backwards and find the integer by inputting the item that was in the dictionary\/list.\n\nThe rest of the questions were almost the same or easier(less steps) than the practice exam. They used different values, but the premise of the question was the same.\n\n  \nBest of luck!\n\n\n\n","permalink":"\/r\/WGU\/comments\/1mevutt\/d335_introduction_to_programming_in_python_passed\/","created_utc":1754053224,"score":10,"text_length":1443,"vader_compound":0.9729,"course_code":"D335"}

I\u2019m an auditory learner, so I mainly used the Amoeba Sisters videos to break everything down. I also had help from someone who took the course and shared their study notes. The course has a LOT of material, and those videos made it much easier to understand. While watching, I took notes and focused hard on the tricky topics\u2014especially meiosis vs. mitosis and their stages, DNA replication, and all the different cell processes.\n\nFor the DNA replication order, what helped me most was repeating this little phrase:  \n\u201cUnwind, \"separate, \"add, form\".  \nIt helped me remember the order and stick it in my brain.\n\nNow for the honest part\u2014the OA was HARD!  Almost all the questions and answers (to me) are worded differently than the PA, so it helps to understand the concepts, not just memorize terms.\u00a0\n\nIf you're trying to knock this out quickly, focus on understanding the processes, not just definitions.

The C723 Study Guide is literally the only thing I used for this class. Read all the intro text and go through the content videos one by one. I take notes by hand because that helps me remember things, but you'll really just need to understand PEMDAS and some basic calculations, like figuring out expected value, some basic probability (if you took the prob\/stats course first this is a breeze), and then the concepts in linear programing. Everything you need to \"memorize\" and understand is on the Formula and Figures pdf given in that study guide. As long as you get the basics, you can pass the test with flying colors. \n\nAgain, all the formulas might look intimidating but it isn't hard at all! Just spend a few hours with the videos and do all the unit quizzes so you understand how to apply what you're learning.\n\nIf anyone has any specific questions about this class feel free to ask!

Disclaimer: I've just started this course, so I haven't passed any tasks yet. I also did a project management class in undergrad. But I was really getting in the weeds with figuring out the details of data migration, costs, etc. Do the Frequent Rejection Reasons webinar if you can. Dr. Sinanovic breaks down everything and gives great tips on what usually gets rejected. If you can't, I've included the screen grabs I got (we were given permission to screen grab since they aren't allowed to record cohort webinars anymore... and he can't send the document he shared either, which is odd... I digress).\n\nPut everything in a word doc. You can create the WBS elsewhere and copy and paste into the doc. I was going to get fancy and separate the project-specific parts from the general answers, but now I'm just going to put everything together. There are several details that aren't in the scenario, like costs - make these up, just make sure the overall budget equals out to $2 mil. Make up the stakeholders\/risk owners as well, I think as long as it makes logical sense, it'll be fine. The biggest thing he said is to include all details from these screenshots (like use the points and templates in the screen grabs and don't use some other project charter template).\n\nFor anyone who hasn't done project management before... Don't waste your time reading\/watching everything unless you're doing the certification exam (I'm not so I have no advice there). The video series provided in the course material is fine, but it's just way too much to get through.

{"post_id":"1mpmjt1","subreddit":"wgu_devs","title":"Passed Intro to Python OA (first try)","selftext":"Hey everyone,\n\nLike the title says, I passed my D335 (intro to python) OA on the first attempt. I wanted to go over what I did to get me there, in hopes that it can help anyone currently going through the course.\n\ntldr: i used peer coaches + zybooks; i hate angela yu\n\n\n\n**\\*\\*\\* USE THE COURSE INSTRUCTORS\/PEER COACHES \\*\\*\\***\n\nI cannot stress this point enough. They are literally there to help explain or walkthrough anything you are unsure about. I used them religiously over the span of almost 2 months. Every time I was stuck on a lab, or was unsure about what the zybooks is saying, I scheduled an appointment. You will eventually get a feel for who you work best with. Plus, I see it as a way to also practice talking through and explaining your code out loud, because I imagine that's what we'll have to do on the job anyways.\n\n**\\*\\*\\* ZYBOOKS \\*\\*\\***\n\nThis may be an unpopular opinion, but I think zybooks was the perfect resource to prepare you for the pre-assessment and OA. Is the material dry? Yes. But so is documentation on pretty much anything programming-related (have you seen the python docs?). \n\nThe way I used zybooks was I went through each chapter, (until 12, if you're using version 2) went through the examples and the labs to the best of my ability. If I couldn't find a solution, no problem, I just stepped away or revisit a lab from a different section I've already completed. Pretty much, repeated this process until I finished all the chapters that would be on the OA.\n\nThen, I went through each 'Additional labs' section, and solved almost every single problem I could on my own. For the problems I was kept getting stuck on and couldn't find solutions for, I'd schedule an appt with a peer coach. Once I knew how to solve it, I would go back and try to understand what the code that works is saying, then delete it and write it myself. You could even try writing the code differently if you know what outcome you need to achieve. **Repetition** is what's important here.\n\nThis process was not quick by any means, and I wouldn't suggest you try going through the course as quick as you can. You will get a much better ROI, if you take your time with this class. \n\n**\\*\\*\\* WEBINAR RECORDINGS \/ EXTERNAL RESOURCES \\*\\*\\***\n\nI only used these when I was stuck on a lab that was covered in a webinar. Also, tbh some of these instructors are just hard to watch because they can be so monotone. The only recordings I really watched were from Mark K, because he gives really good tips and has a tone that fluctuates lol.\n\nI also tried to give Angela Yu's: 100 days of code a try but I could not stay engaged. I was cringed out by the overly-positive tone that I couldn't take the course serious. I realize that's a me problem. I got to day 7 and tapped-out. I think it's worth checking out, but I wouldn't use that as your primary source to learn from. It's basically just tutorial hell imo. You're better off struggling on a lab in zybooks, and referencing the section relating to your lab for help. There's beauty in struggle.\n\n  \n**FInal thoughts:**\n\nWhat worked for me may or may not work for you, but I was able to pass with a perfect score on my pre-assessment and missed like one question on the OA. Once you get a better understanding of Python, the coursework actually becomes fun and engaging. If you're stuck, reach out for help. (you literally pay for it)\n\n","permalink":"\/r\/wgu_devs\/comments\/1mpmjt1\/passed_intro_to_python_oa_first_try\/","created_utc":1755133793,"score":8,"text_length":3430,"vader_compound":0.9942,"course_code":"D335"}

I didn\u2019t study much on weekends because I wanted to spend that time with family \u2014 and that balance really helped me stay sane.\n\nLike many of you, I checked Reddit for tips. Some posts helped, but honestly, the most effective approach for me was sticking to my own study plan:\n\n* **Read the textbook**\n* **Do the in-text and practice quizzes (if available)**\n* **Use ChatGPT or YouTube for topics I didn\u2019t fully understand**\n* **Check and use any supplemental materials in the \u201cResources\u201d section**\n\nOne thing I *don\u2019t* recommend is trying to shortcut the courses. I failed two OAs because I tried to \u201cgame the system\u201d by just taking the PA, then only studying the weak areas. That method didn't work for me at all \u2014 I had way better results when I just committed to learning the material from start to finish.\n\nThe only time I didn\u2019t read the textbook was for the **LAW** courses \u2014 I just watched the videos and reviewed the PowerPoints, and that was enough to pass.\n\n**Courses I found the hardest:**\n\n* **Algebra**\n* **Physical Science**\n* **D075** \n\nIf anyone has questions about specific courses or how I studied, feel free to ask! Just a heads-up \u2014 I don\u2019t have any shortcuts or \u201ceasy pass\u201d tips. I\u2019m more of a head-down, do-the-work type of learner.\n\nI'm left with three most courses this term and I'm done! \n\nHope this helps someone out!","permalink":"\/r\/wguaccounting\/comments\/1ml6x8e\/wgu_accounting_course_overview_study_approach\/","created_utc":1754686817,"score":22,"text_length":1973,"vader_compound":0.9812,"course_code":"D075"}
{"post_id":"1mkcm8j","subreddit":"wguaccounting","title":"Passed D196! Don\u2019t psych yourself out (like me)","selftext":"I got this course done in about four days, which I know isn\u2019t as fast as some of y\u2019all, but I\u2019m gonna be honest: I was stressing mySELF out reading about people speedrunning a whole business degree only to get stuck on this one class for a month. I figured there had to be something I was missing. \n\nI don\u2019t have a ton of advice. Forcing myself to memorize all those equations instead of just referencing a sheet before going in was probably not a good use of my time\u2026 but I did it, lol. And like\u2026 great, but at what cost? I could have been done by now!\n\nThe only thing I really had to write down was some last-minute notes on the Excel stuff. Horizontal analysis didn\u2019t come naturally to me. I get it, but to me, all data is just data. To my mind, there\u2019s no real difference between seeing a change from 50k to 100k represented as a 200% increase vs. a $50k difference. I\u2019m gonna do that math in my head either way. It was strangely hard for me to internalize that there was a \u201cright\u201d way and I ended up having to just drill it into my head last minute and then write it down as soon as I was able to. \n\nWhat helped me most was writing everything down. I rarely even looked at the notes again, but the act of writing helped stuff stick. Like, I couldn\u2019t recite the exact order of manufacturing budgeting if you asked me (I\u2019d try, but I\u2019d want to look it up \ud83d\ude02), but writing it all down and reviewing all the vocab was enough to help me pick the right answer on multiple choice, like to kind of know what looks right. If I saw a highlighted vocab word, I wrote it down and defined it \u2014 even if I already knew it \u2014 because it helped me distinguish between stuff I know from life and stuff the course wanted me to know.\n\nOne more tip: I usually bookmark questions I\u2019m unsure about and come back to them later, and in most classes, that works great for me. But in this one? Almost every single time I went back and changed an answer, it turned out I had it right *before* I changed it. So yeah, moral of the story: do not overthink it. YMMV obviously!\n\nIf you\u2019re already working in accounting or have a background in it, don\u2019t let the horror stories stress you out. I easily could\u2019ve finished this at least a day earlier, and I\u2019m kicking myself for wasting time (especially since I\u2019m trying to knock out a whole-ass accounting degree with a full-time job and three kids). But hey, I\u2019m done. That\u2019s what counts!","permalink":"\/r\/wguaccounting\/comments\/1mkcm8j\/passed_d196_dont_psych_yourself_out_like_me\/","created_utc":1754602034,"score":23,"text_length":2464,"vader_compound":0.9693,"course_code":"D196"}

I didn't read the book, but I went through the PowerPoint and videos that Wiley has and did a ton of practice problems via the knowledge checks in Wiley.  The PA lines up decently with the OA, however I'd say both the OA can go a bit more in depth and had a few surprises.  This is definitely not one of those courses you can BS through, as pretty much everything is covered one way or another on the exam.  Don't bother memorizing the formulas since they give you a formula sheet but understanding when and how to use them is key! \n\nAll in all, it's a manageable course if you pace yourself and stay consistent. The videos on Wiley aren't that time consuming which helps to move swiftly, but definitely make sure you have a good grasp on the material going into the OA.

Have general ideas of the theories and the theorist behind them. Write the basic points down.\n5. Listen to recorded cohorts. They summarize a lot of the info in the lessons.

I've completed all my requirements to apply for early clinicals, and the application has opened. I was about to apply, however, I have several questions and I've received some contradictory information from my program mentor. Before I email others, such as the clinical experience liaison, I wanted to ask the community here. Due to unforeseen circumstances, I'm much further behind in my coursework than I expected to be by this date. I am still 8 courses away from the D726, \"Early Clinical Education\" course. Should I wait until I am a few courses closer to apply for early clinicals? It says I must complete the course and 15-hour classroom experience within four months. At the rate I'm going, I'm averaging about 1 course every 3 weeks, so that's beyond 4 months. I will try to speed up to 1 course every 1-2 weeks, but there's no guarantee. I'm not sure what date I should list as the date I am available to start my clinical experience. Can I change it later if I'm not enrolled in D726 yet? I'm also not sure how long the placement will take in the first place. Hopefully, my facilitator will work with me on this; however, I'm anxious to hear how long it took others and if I can change the order I complete courses for the MATEES program. My program mentor said no, but others have said yes. Maybe the rules have changed? It's nice to hear about others' experiences! Thanks all!

I did 100 practice questions for each section. This was very helpful because if I missed certain questions, it would give me 5-10 additional questions about the same subject. I was a little weak with IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS. I was also weak with RTO, RPO, etc. By the end of it, I could answer most questions with those subjects from the additional preparation. It would also explain to me why it was wrong and help me further understand the issue.\n\nI also used practice tests that are available in the course material. It has questions that are worded similarly to the actual exam. This helped me prepare for the style of questions that would be asked, so do not pass it up. \n\nI started the class on August 1st and sat for the exam yesterday to pass.

As I begin writing this, I want to preface this by saying that this class was difficult, but the exam was not to the extent of difficulty you would think. If you understand the material. Heres what I did:\n\n* Read everything and took notes by hand. This helped me better remember information.\n* Watched the videos. The short cohorts helped for the common struggle areas.\n* At the end of the book, all of the key terms are there. I went through all of these and copied them exactly by hand.\n* Used the study guide.\n* I used ChatGPT and uploaded the study guide and a full set of key terms. I went through each Competency one by one using fake situational questions with ChatGPT. The key is situational here; most of the questions on the actual exam have more of a situational aspect to them. I saw that stated on one of the Reddit posts as well. \n* I know that for most people, they recommend just relaxing on the day of the exam. I didn't do this; I continued to study with Chat GPT. Literally from 9 am-11 PM. Then took my exam at 11:20 PM\n* I took the preassessment upon beginning the class, then again for the second time on the day of the exam. I barely passed the second attempt at the PA. So I watched the short Cohort videos on the areas I didn't do well. I then reviewed all the answers on the PA and took the PA a third time just before my actual exam. \n\nAll in all, I believe it's possible for others to pass this course. I felt like the actual exam was easier than the PA, more because I went through everything in a situational context with Chat GPT, and I really felt like it helped. I spent a total of 50 hours on this course. I would say if you can dedicate that amount of time and have a background in business leadership, you should be okay. For someone without a background, I would say double that amount of time to really get your footing.\n\nWith that said, I am so glad this course is done!

(These methods may not work for everyone, but I hope it helps someone)\n\nTechnically, I started this course 2 weeks ago; however, I didn't actually start fully studying until yesterday due to my work\/life schedule. That said, I did cram the course into 2 days. I started out by taking the PA to see where I sat, and I failed with many areas \"approaching competency\" or \"unsatisfactory\" - Yikes! I downloaded the Study Plan course resource which has questions and answers directly from the Wiley Resource textbook. I opted to utilize the Wiley Resource textbook directly rather than the course material and the textbook had so many tools! I downloaded the PowerPoints for each chapter and studied these while taking notes to help the information stick and took each end-of-chapter quiz to test my knowledge and fill in gaps. The PowerPoints didn't cover everything, but enough of the key points to help learn. After studying for 2 days, I took the PA again and scored worlds better! Although the questions are the same, I barely remember what was asked the first time, so it was like taking a new quiz. \n\nAfter passing the PA and feeling good about my score, I scheduled the OA 30 minutes later while the knowledge was still fresh. While taking the quiz, I bookmarked every question I felt meh about or wanted to come back to and utilized the process of elimination for some. Many of the questions did resemble the PA where it was multiple choice. The test is only 58 questions, which doesn't seem like a lot compared to the amount of knowledge covered. That said, the course resource provided does state that the assessment is broken down by 12% Organizational Structure, 25% Business Marketing, 8% Operations and Quality Management, 12% Economic Analysis, 23% Financial Analysis, 8% Accounting, and 12% Information Systems. \n\nThis is very accurate as the test was very marketing and finance geared (48%) with an additional 20% Economics and Accounting. This means approximately 39 of the 58 questions are geared toward these areas! That said, I would give an extra focus on these areas while also studying the other chapters on key terms. \n\nGood luck taking this course!

{"post_id":"1mtk0e6","subreddit":"WGU_MBA","title":"C207 Pass & Tips","selftext":"I really didn't like this course. Don't get me wrong, I liked the content, but I didn't care for the presentation. I got an exemplary on the OA and my PAs were accepted the first time, but I wasn't that confident going into the OA.\n\nC207's all about taking data and figuring out how to use it to make informed decisions. It's got 2 Practical Assessments and an Objective Assessment. Take the 2 PA's first. There's a link at the bottom of this post with the videos for them. What worked for me was to watch all of the videos for the task, then start the task and do each step with the corresponding video. I felt this helped me see the forest for the trees, so to speak. \n\nI felt the tasks themselves were relatively easy since the videos walk you through each step and Excel does all the math for you. It'll probably take you a few hours to do both, and I recommend going slowly and making an effort to learn and understand what's going on. You'll see that stuff again in the OA.\n\nFor the OA itself, know what each statistical tool is and when to use it, you'll see that a lot on the exam. Also, focus on the content about quality metrics and tools - Results Driven Management, Six Sigma, Lean, etc. I saw a few questions on Six Sigma, none on Lean that I can recall, but make sure you know the difference (Six Sigma = Perfection, Lean = getting rid of stuff). The cohorts were pretty good, but I ended up reviewing a few things in the book after I passed the practice assessment because it covered things I didn't remember seeing in the cohorts (not many, but a few). ABSOLUTELY DO THE \"ARE YOU SMARTER\" COHORT. I'd also recommend doing the end of unit quizzes in the book as well.\n\nThe assessments themselves have some oddly worded questions. I wouldn't say they're on the level of some tests that try to trip you up, but I suspect some of them were by a non-native English speaker. For example, I recall the practice assessment that talked about linear regression saying \"The null hypothesis should be rejected at 5%\", which really meant \"The null hypothesis WAS rejected at 5%\" and you'll need to answer accordingly.\n\nTo recap: Use the link below to for easier access to course resources than WGU Connect. Do the two tasks first, watch the videos before starting the task, then rewatch while following along. Do the Cohort recordings ( I didn't do Jeopardy since you have to email the CIs for the answers ), do the Are You Smarter video, then take the practice. Review what you got wrong in the practice with the book and take the end of unit quizzes.\n\nI used this instead of trying to navigate WGU Connect each time: [https:\/\/westerngovernorsuniversity.sharepoint.com\/sites\/C207Data-DrivenDecisionMakingResources\/SitePages\/DepartmentHome.aspx?csf=1&web=1&e=yWjezn&CID=b6d52c82-427f-454a-ae92-839795fbe572](https:\/\/westerngovernorsuniversity.sharepoint.com\/sites\/C207Data-DrivenDecisionMakingResources\/SitePages\/DepartmentHome.aspx?csf=1&web=1&e=yWjezn&CID=b6d52c82-427f-454a-ae92-839795fbe572)\n\n  \nGood luck!","permalink":"\/r\/WGU_MBA\/comments\/1mtk0e6\/c207_pass_tips\/","created_utc":1755518440,"score":10,"text_length":2659,"vader_compound":0.991,"course_code":"C207"}

I saw one and used that Quizlet so I\u2019m reposting because it worked.\n\nStep one- Take the PA, don\u2019t rely on the PA as a whole. Obviously.\n\nStep two- Watch the instructor videos. Just do it. They\u2019re all short (3 minutes or so) and give a general guideline of focus points in the material if you haven\u2019t read it in full. \n\nStep three and MOST beneficial (for me at least)- Read the flashcards for this Quizlet linked below and then keep taking the tests on there until you nail it. I change the amount from \u201c20 Questions\u201d to 55 at a time to keep it similar to the OA. Eventually, I did all 98 multiple times until I didn\u2019t miss one. \nI finished the OA\u2019s 56 questions in 17 minutes. \n\nAce the Quizlet- ace the exam.

{"post_id":"1mvm3oa","subreddit":"wguaccounting","title":"D101 - Tips! Passed in 4 Days","selftext":"Hi all, \n\nThis class has a lot of information hence why I am making this post.  The book can get confusing so here is how I was able to pass the class in 4 days. \n\nJob costing and Process Costing - read the book, take the quizzes and unit test. For me, this was the most easy to understand. - as you read the book not all will make sense and that\u2019s okay. Continue reading and it\u2019ll make more sense as you take the unit test and quizzes. \n\nABC , CVP, Standard Cost and Variances - I didn\u2019t read the book, when I got to these chapters I got so confused with the material. It got overwhelming so what I did was took the PA - of course, I failed \ud83e\udd23 . Happy that I did tho, because I got the answer key for the excel portion of the exam for master budgeting. Maybe they send the answer key for the excel when you fail the PA? \n\nWhen I finally pass the OA I didn\u2019t get the excel answer key. \n\nAnyways, there is a few short video about the 3 topics above. Watch. Practice and solve the problem on the videos. - What worked for me was watching these videos multiple times - since it\u2019s only 5-10 mins in length.  You can find it on 2nd and 3rd page of \u201cD101 Video Resources\u201d found in  additional resources page of WGU connect.\n\nMaster Budgeting and Differential Analysis - I didn\u2019t read the book - I watched the video from the same doc above ^. My advice is watch these videos multiple times as well. \n\nThe PA really aligns with the OA. Take the PA as many times you need - to understand how to solve each problem . I took it 4x. 1 - failing it intentionally, and 3 times to practice solving each of the problem. \n\nTo be honest, there\u2019s a lot of formulas and things to know in this class to pass the oa. What worked for me was focusing on how to solve the problems and not worry about definitions and terms.  When you know how to solve each problem in the PA, then you are ready for the OA.\n\nAlso, don\u2019t use whiteboard . You will take this exam using excel so create a new sheet tab and solve using that. Much faster and easier. \n\nAnother tip, Brittany Larson posted tips on how to pass and memorize some of the formulas you can find it in WGU connect. It was super helpful and what I also used  ( to memorize the formulas) - Read it after you watch the videos and take the PA and OA.\n\nAnd last tip, if you are trying to pass this class sooner rather than later then focus on solving the problems. Theres a lot of information and I could have passed this class on the 3rd day but wanted to really make sure I pass the class, so I did another day to study. Even then, I don\u2019t think it helped much because you will forget some of the formula and some information because again this is a lot of material to understand and formula\u2019s to memorize\n\nMy advice - \n\n1. Read units you want, watch the videos then take  PA while using  your notes, and referring back to  videos when needed. Study what you didn\u2019t get right. \n2. Take the PA again - aim to pass using the formulas only. \n3. Before you take the 3rd PA memorize the formulas and solve each problems without your notes. Practice dumping all the formulas and info you need in an excel multiple times before taking the last PA. When you pass, and understand what you didn\u2019t get right then take the OA. \n\nAgain, this course has a lot of information, and you will remember some and forget some, and that\u2019s okay. The more you study, the more you watch the videos on repeat, the more you practice the PA and remember the formulas and understand what\u2019s it\u2019s asking the better you will do in the OA.  With me, since the formulas were a lot, and grasping how to solve and use each formulas was a lot, I didn\u2019t bother reading and studying the definitions. If you have more time to spare, I recommend getting familiar with the different terms and definitions in the book. \n\nI didn\u2019t read the book on the other sections, and my guess is that\u2019s why I didn\u2019t scored well on the other sections. If you wanna study definitions I recommend the glossary.\n\nThe excel in PA is same in the version of  my OA. Practice practice practice. Understand how to fill out each and all in the statements. Even the ones that are already filled out for you. \n\n\n","permalink":"\/r\/wguaccounting\/comments\/1mvm3oa\/d101_tips_passed_in_4_days\/","created_utc":1755712512,"score":10,"text_length":4173,"vader_compound":0.9801,"course_code":"D101"}
